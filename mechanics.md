# Mechanics
Continuation of Ashford employs a number of customized mechanics that we believe improve the player experience. Below you'll find these updated Mechanics.

# Character Creation Rule Changes 
(`TODO`: move to sub-page? move to Character Creation?)
## Classes

### Barbarian
Berserker Barbarian subclass replaces the Frenzy feature at 3rd level with 2 new features, amends one and adds its own.
They are as follows:

> **Frenzy**
> 
>> When you Rage you can choose to Frenzy. While in a Frenzy you gain a Brutal Critical die, this stacks with the number of dice granted by the Brutal Critical feature you gain at 9th level.
> 
> **Reckless Frenzy**
> 
>> Once per round, if you make a Reckless Attack during a Frenzy and hit, you can deal extra damage using your Brutal Critical dice, even when the attack is not a critical hit. When you use this feature you suffer a level exhaustion at the end of your rage.
> 
> **Intimidating Presence**
> 
>> Has an amendment to the third sentence: "...If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier (if positive, minimum of 0) + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn."
> 
> **Unceasing Battle**
> 
>> When your rage ends, making a Constitution saving throw. The DC is equal to 10 + 5 times the number of the Frenzy feature used since your last long rest. On a pass you can suppress the levels of exhaustion gained from the Frenzy feature until the end of your next rage. This DC resets on a long rest.

### Ranger
(`TODO`: Clarify this section. Existing documentation is not clear.)

**Ranger: Favored Foe**

1st-level ranger optional feature, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature

You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the Hunter's Mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a certain number of times without expending a spell slot equal to your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1). Once you reach 6 levels in the ranger class, you do not require concentration on Hunter's Mark. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, when you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, Hunter's Mark doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

**Ranger: Favored Foe**

has been amended as follows: "At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack and damage rolls against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll but before any effects are applied."

### Fighter 

**Arcane Archer**

Arcane Shot has a number of uses equal to 2 + proficency bonus.

**Echo Knight**

For the purposes of (creature) type, the echo is an object.

### Cleric 

**Twilight**

Eyes of Night has its Darkvision restored to infinite and the wording is as follows: "Your eyes are blessed, allowing you to see through the deepest gloom. You have darkvision with no maximum range; you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

### Monk

**The monk's capstone "Perfect Self" has been changed.** The existing ability has been replaced with the following:

> For one turn, all ki point costs are halved to a minimum of 1. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. In addition, when you hit an attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can add your wisdom modifier to the damage roll.

### Rogue

**Steady Aim**

The optional feature Steady Aim requires you to not move at all during your turn, which includes being on a mount or flying item.

## Feats

### Brawny
Should a Small creature gain the feat Brawny (UA: Feats for Skills, pg. 1), they may ignore the Heavy property of any weapon within reason. (i.e. greatsword, greataxe, etc.)

### Lucky
If a creature has the Lucky feat (PHB, pg. 167) or any other source of luck points, it may only use one luck point per turn.

### Dual Wielder
The Dual Wielder (PHB pg. 165) text is replaced with the following:

> You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
> 
> Before you take the Attack action while wielding two light melee weapons, you can choose to make the attacks at a -5 penalty. If you choose to do so, you can make an additional attack. If you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make additional attacks equal to 1 + the number of extra attacks you have.

(i.e. an 11th level fighter can make 3 attacks normally or 6 attacks at a -5 penalty.)

## Skill/Proficiency

Firearms are a weapon type that a character can learn proficiency for. To do so, said character must first have proficiency in martial weapons. Should this requirement be met, learning the proficiency follows the same rules as learning a tool proficiency as outlined in âœ¦downtimes or Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGE, pg. 134)

## Spells

### Chronurgy and Graviturgy Wizard Spells

The spells added by Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (EGW) to the Chronurgy and Graviturgy wizard subclasses are now standard in the Wizard spells table.

### Teleportation Circle

Teleportation Circle is now a ritual spell.

### Psionic Disciplines

Usage of Psionic Disciplines from the Mystic Class are considered spellcasting for the purposes of raging.

### Skywrite

The Skywrite spell (XGE pg. 165) now reads as the following (**bolded changes**):

> You cause up to ten words to form in a part of the sky you can see. The words appear to be made of cloud and remain in place for the spell's duration. The words dissipate when the spell ends. **A strong wind can disperse the clouds but if you are still concentrating for the duration you may reform the words.**

### Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (PHB pg. 264) now reads as the following (**bolded changes**):

> A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.
> 
> **Nothing - not physical objects, energy, spell effects or spell-like effects - can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there.** The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.
> 
> The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.
> 
> A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

### True Polymorph
True Polymorph has the following additions:
> You cannot polymorph a creature or object into a named creature that has its own stat block/sheet separate from a generic version of its race/type."

### Clone
Clone (PHB pg. 222) now reads as the following (**bolded changes**):

> **This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living Small or Medium creature as a safeguard against death.** This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.
> 
> At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

### Simulacrum
A Simulacrum cannot cast the Wish or Simulacrum spells.

## Race

### Minotaurs

* Must use the most recent printing (currently Mythic Odysseys of Theros). 
* Now also have the Powerful Build feat. 
* In addition, you may ignore/exchange their racial origin and alignment set forth in MOT if you so choose.

## Attunements

### Magic tattoos

Magic tattoos have an amendment to their Tattoo Attunement feature:

> If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. You are still subject to the space requirements of the Magic Tattoo Coverage table (TCE pg. 118).

### Summoned Creatures

Creatures summoned through spells, acquired in sessions, created, or otherwise obtained through class features with an INT of 4 or less may equip/attune to 3 magic items at maximum or 4 magic items with an INT of 6.

Creatures with an INT of 10 or above may attune/equip to items as shown in [Character Creation](character_creation.md). A creature must have the proper anatomy to attune to/equip a magic item, such as creatures with hooves or bird-like talons cannot wear shoes. You cannot give a creature acquired in these ways a piercing, ingest or otherwise rest on or in the item some way to circumvent this. Creatures found these ways may not artificially increase a stat to gain additional attunement slots, such as a headband of intellect, nor have them attune to the item they were summoned from such as a Shield Guardian attuning to a Shield Guardian amulet ad nauseam. Player characters are exempt from this ruling unless their Intelligence score is 6 or lower

## Items

### Tomes and Manuals

If a character uses one of the manuals, tomes or a similar item, the cooldown extends to all future copies in addition to the item used for that character i.e. If a character uses a Manual of Gainful Exercise or Tome of Leadership and Influence, the time in which it takes to use that manual again extends to any of that item found in the future.

### +3 Armor (Generic variant)

+3 Armor (Generic variant) has its rarity amended to very rare, wondrous

This only includes breastplate, chain mail/shirt, half-plate, hide, (studded) leather, padded, plate, ring, scale, spiked and splint armor.

### Amulet of the Devout

Amulet of the Devout only increases the spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs of your cleric or paladin spells.

### Shield Guardian

Shield Guardian has its rarity increased to very rare.

## Taming
(`TODO`: move to Downtime Actions?)

Players can spend downtime capturing and taming creatures to be their mount. For normal mounts they can be bought as shown in the item table.

* You must have a stronghold that can accommodate your mount while you tame it.
* Creatures of 8 intelligence or higher cannot be tamed and named/titled/homebrew creatures are disallowed.
* This takes 1 downtime per CR of the creature being tamed, each downtime requires an animal handling check of 10 + CR + Creature INT mod.
* The DM rules which creatures can be trained. Both with regards to having the appropriate anatomy to be comfortably mounted, and with regards whether this creature has instincts that cannot be suppressed. (Things that consume souls for example, like the Hellfire Engine.)
  
## Beyond 20: Prestige

As a character of legendary reputation and renown - be it fame or infamy - your adventures do not stop there. This feature is available only to level 20 characters and these benefits can be taken once every three sessions of an applicable bracket. Any sessions considered 'arena sessions' are exempt from this and as such will not count, nor do your sessions towards a legendary item search. If you were level 20 before this feature was introduced you do not get to use it retroactively, downtime-wise. This is passive - but must be done during a downtime, and only then - and therefore not a downtime activity. Downtimes earned by `@Dungeon Masters` are applicable. You cannot stack boons, blessings or use Alternatives to Epic Boons.

**Boon of High Magic**

Modification: If you have the Spellcasting class feature, you gain 1 additional spell slot of the highest spell-slot level you have. If you have the Mystic Arcanum feature, you gain 1 additional use of the highest Mystic Arcanum you have. If you have both, you choose which one you get, you can only get this boon once.

**EXP Exchange**
| Amount  | Result                      |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| 55,000  | Receive 1 Blessing. ASI received from these are allowed.          |
| 100,000 | Receive an additional Feat. Feats taken in this way do not grant ASI. OR you can increase an ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1. This can only be taken if you chose a feat instead of an ASI during the leveling process.|
| 120,000 | Receive 1 Boon.             |

# In-Combat Rule Changes
(`TODO`: move to sub-page?)

## Spellcasting Economy

**As long as you have the capability to you may cast all possible spells regardless of action economy.**

For example:
* You can cast a spell requiring a Bonus Action as an Action.
* You can **not** cast a spell requiring an Action as a Bonus Action
* You can cast Fireball and Shadow Blade on the same turn, despite requiring two spell slots.

## Combat Movement

* Opportunity attacks can only be taken against targets you can see.
* If a creature is moved **without** using its own movement it does not provoke an opportunity attack (i.e. a creature pushed by the Repelling Blast Eldritch Invocation, the Open Hand Monk Flurry of Blows or one held/grappled by a creature). If it uses its own movement **even against its will** it does provoke an opportunity attack (Command, Turn Undead, Dissonant Whispers, etc).
* Items 'of flying' (broom, carpet, etc) have their own speed instead of giving you a speed, therefore its movement is completely independent from your own and it has no action so cannot dash. 
* Chariots and other animal-drawn vehicles would differ as they are dependent on the speed of a creature which does have action economy.

## Area of Effect (AOE) & Cover

If an area of effect covers at least half a square, it affects that square.

To determine whether a target has cover against an attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the attacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including another creature) the target has half cover. If three or four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit) the target has three-quarters cover.

(`TODO`: need image. Discord image is broken.)

## Grapple

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.

Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Moving a Grappled Target**

When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

**Examples of features, feats or traits that do not allow grapple are:**

* Barbarian Berserker feature Retaliation: "Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature."
* Monk Astral Self feature Arms of the Astral Self: "You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes."
* Polearm Master: "While you are wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, quarterstaff, or spear, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach."

**Examples of features or traits that *do* allow grapple are:**

* Simic Hybrid race trait Grappling Appendage: "As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature."
* Loxodon race trait Trunk: "You can grasp things with your trunk...grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike."
