if you are already a Rogue.

skill of your choice from the Rogue’s skill list.

## Rogue Class Features
As a Rogue, you gain the following class features 
when you reach the specified levels in this class. 
These features are listed on the Rogue table.

### Expertise
***Levels**: 1st, 6th*

*Each time you gain this feature, you*{color:#D35400} gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

Sleight of Hand and Stealth are iconic choices 
for a Rogue if you have proficiency in them.

### Sneak Attack
***Levels**: 1st  (see Rogue Table for higher levels)*

You know how to turn a subtle attack into a 
deadly one. Once per turn, you can deal extra 
damage to one creature you hit with an attack 
roll if you’re attacking with a Finesse or Ranged 
weapon and if at least one of the following 
requirements is met:
**Advantage.** You have Advantage on the Attack Roll.
**Ally Adjacent to Target.** At least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition, and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.

To determine the extra damage, roll a number 
of d6s equal to half your Rogue level (round up), 
and add the dice together (the Rogue table 
shows the number of Sneak Attack dice you get 
at each Rogue level). The extra damage’s type is 
the same as the weapon’s Damage Type.

### Thieves' Cant
***Levels**: 1st*

You picked up various languages in the 
communities where you plied your roguish 
talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other 
language of your choice, which you choose from 
the Standard Languages and Rare Languages 
tables.

### Weapon Mastery
***Levels**: 1st*

Your training with weapons allows you to use 
the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons of 
your choice with which you have proficiency, 
such as Daggers and Shortbows.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can 
change the kinds of weapons you chose. For 
example, you could switch to using the Mastery 
properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.


### Cunning Action
***Levels**: 2nd*

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to 
move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take 
one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: 
Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

### Steady Aim
***Levels**: 3rd*

As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage 
on your next attack roll on the current turn. You 
can use this feature only if you haven’t moved 
during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed 
is 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Rogue Subclass and Features
***Levels**: 3rd, 9th, 13th, 17th*

You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice, such as:  Arcane 
Trickster, Assassin, Swashbuckler, or Thief. 
UA Subclasses are detailed after this class’s 
description.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you 
special abilities at certain Rogue levels. For the 
rest of your career, you gain each of your 
subclass’s features that are of your Rogue level 
and lower.

### Ability Score Improvement
***Levels**: 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 19th*

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Cunning Strike
***Levels**: 5th*

You have developed cunning ways to use your 
Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack 
damage, you can add one of the following 
Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, 
which is the number of Sneak Attack damage 
dice you must forego to add the effect. You 
remove the die before rolling, and the effect 
occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is 
dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, 
remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage 
before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving 
throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier.

**Disarm (Cost: 1d6).** The target must succeed 
on a Dexterity saving throw, or it drops one item 
of your choice that it’s holding.

**Poison (Cost: 1d6).** You add a toxin to your 
strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the 
Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of 
each of its turns, the Poisoned target can repeat 
the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s 
Kit on your person.

**Trip (Cost: 1d6).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

**Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).** Immediately after the 
attack, you move up to half your Speed without 
provoking Opportunity Attacks.


### Uncanny Dodge
***Levels**: 5th*

When an attacker that you can see hits you with 
an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to halve 
the attack’s damage against you (round down).

### Evasion
***Levels**: 7th*

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain 
dangers. When you are subjected to an effect 
that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw
to take only half damage, you instead take no 
damage if you succeed on the saving throw and 
only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this 
feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.

### Reliable Talent
***Levels**: 7th*

You have refined your talents until they 
approach perfection. Whenever you make an 
ability check that uses one of your skill or Tool 
proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or 
lower as a 10

### Improved Cunning Strike
***Levels**: 11th*

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects 
when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the 
die cost for each effect.

### Devious Strikes
***Levels**: 14th*

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak 
Attack deviously. The following effects are now 
among your Cunning Strike options.

**Daze (Cost: 2d6).** The target must succeed on 
a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Dazed
condition until the end of its next turn.

**Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).** The target must 
succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has 
the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until
it takes any damage. The Unconscious target can 
repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Obscure (Cost: 3d6).** You strike near the 
target’s eyes. The target must succeed on a 
Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded 
condition until the end of its next turn.


### Slippery Mind
***Levels**: 15th*

Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to 
control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and 
Charisma saving throws.

### Elusive
***Levels**: 18th*

You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the 
upper hand against you. No attack roll can have
Advantage against you unless you have the 
Incapacitated condition.

### Stroke of Luck
***Levels**: 20th*

You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when 
you need to. If you fail a d20 Test, you can turn 
the roll into a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again 
until you finish a Short Rest or a Long Rest.

## Rogue Subclasses 
A Rogue subclass is a specialization that grants 
you special abilities at certain Rogue levels, as 
specified in the subclass.

This section presents the Arcane Trickster, 
Assassin, Swashbuckler, and Thief subclasses.

## Arcane Trickster
Some Rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of 
stealth and agility with Arcane spells, learning 
magical tricks to aid them in their trade. Some 
Arcane Tricksters use their talents as 
pickpockets and burglars, while others are 
pranksters, mischief-makers, or adventurers.


### Spellcasting
***Levels**: 3rd*

You have learned to cast spells. See the Spellcasting chapter for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.

**Cantrips.** You know three cantrips: Mage Hand
and two other cantrips of your choice from the 
Wizard spell list.

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can 
replace one of your cantrips, except Mage Hand, 
with another cantrip of your choice from the 
Wizard spell list.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you 
learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

**Spell Slots.** The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting 
table shows how many spell slots you have to 
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast 
one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the 
spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended 
spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level.** You prepare a 
list of spells of 1st level and higher that are 
available for you to cast with this feature. To 
start, choose three 1st-level spells from the 
 Wizard spell list, two of which must be from the 
Enchantment and Illusion schools of magic.

The number of spells on your list increases as 
you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared 
Spells column of the Arcane Trickster 
Spellcasting table. Whenever that number 
increases, choose additional spells from the 
 Wizard spell list until the number of spells on 
your list matches the number on the table. The 
chosen spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 7th-level 
Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include 
six Arcane spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any 
combination.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever 
you gain a level in this class, you can replace one 
of the spells you know with another spell of your 
choice from the  Wizard spell list. The new spell 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your 
spellcasting ability for your Arcane Trickster 
spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane 
Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you 
prepare for this subclass.

| 20th  |   11   |   4   |   3   |   3   |   1   |



### Mage Hand Legerdemain
***Levels**: 3rd*

When you cast Mage Hand, you can make the 
spectral hand invisible. You can control the hand 
as a Bonus Action, instead of an action, and
through it, you can use Thieves’ Tools and make 
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.

### Magical Ambush
***Levels**: 9th*

If you have the Invisible condition when you cast 
a spell on a creature, it has Disadvantage on any 
saving throw it makes against the spell on the 
same turn.


### Versatile Trickster
***Levels**: 13th*

You gain the ability to distract targets with your 
Mage Hand. When you use the Disarm or Trip 
options of your Cunning Strike, you can also
target that option at a creature within 5 feet of 
the spectral hand.

### Spell Thief
***Levels**: 17th*

You gain the ability to magically steal the 
knowledge of how to cast a spell from another 
spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that 
targets you or includes you in its area of effect, 
you can use your Reaction to force the creature 
to make a saving throw with its spellcasting 
ability modifier. The DC equals your Spell Save 
DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect 
against you, and you steal the knowledge of the 
spell if it is at least *level 1*{color:#D35400} and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be an Arcane spell). 
For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can 
cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t 
cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again 
until you finish a Long Rest.

## Assassin
An Assassin’s training focuses on the grim art of 
death, using stealth, poison, and disguise to 
eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While 
some Rogues who follow this path are hired 
killers, spies, or bounty hunters, the capabilities 
of this subclass are equally useful for 
adventurers facing a variety of monstrous 
enemies.

### Bonus Proficiencies
***Levels**: 3rd*

You gain proficiency with the Disguise Kit and 
Poisoner’s Kit

### Assassinate
***Levels**: 3rd*

granting you the following benefits:

**Initiative.** You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.<br>
**Surprising Strikes.** During the first round of each combat, you have Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. If your Sneak Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon’s type equal to your Rogue level.

### Infiltration Expertise
***Levels**: 9th*

You are expert at posing as someone else to aid 
your infiltrations. While in a disguise created 
using your Disguise Kit, you have Advantage on 
any Charisma (Deception) check you make while 
pretending to be someone else. You can also 
unerringly mimic another person’s speech,
handwriting, or both if you have spent at least
one hour studying each one

### Envenom Weapons
***Levels**: 13th*

When you use the Poison option of your Cunning 
Strike, the target also takes 2d6 Poison damage 
whenever it fails the saving throw. This damage 
ignores resistance to Poison damage

### Death Strike
***Levels**: 17th*

When you hit with your Sneak Attack on the first 
round of a combat, the target must succeed on a 
Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity 
modifier + your Proficiency Bonus), or the 
attack’s damage is doubled against the target.


## Swashbuckler
As a Swashbuckler, you focus on the art of the 
blade, bringing speed, elegance, and charm to 
your combat style—topped off with an exquisite 
flourish of panache. You excel in single combat, 
and your methods make a duel look like a 
flamboyant performance.

### Fancy Footwork
***Levels**: 3rd*

You’ve learned how to land a strike and then slip 
away without reprisal. If you make a melee 
attack against a creature during your turn, that 
creature can’t make Opportunity Attacks against 
you for the rest of that turn.

### Rakish Audacity
***Levels**: 3rd*

When you roll Initiative, you can give yourself a 
bonus to the roll equal to your Charisma 
modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your 
Sneak Attack; you don’t need Advantage on the 
attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a 
creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other 
creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don’t 
have Disadvantage on the attack roll. All the 
other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

### Panache
***Levels**: 9th*

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak 
Attack. The following effects are now among 
your Cunning Strike options.

**Goad (Cost: 1d6).** The target must succeed on 
a Wisdom saving throw, or until the end of its 
next turn, the target has Disadvantage on attack 
rolls against targets other than you and can’t 
make Opportunity Attacks against targets other 
than you. 

**Awe (Cost: 3d6).** Each creature of your choice 
within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom 
saving throw or have the Charmed condition 
until the end of your next turn.

### Dashing Strikes
***Levels**: 13th*

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak 
Attack. The following effects are now among 
your Cunning Strike options.

**Parrying Stance (Cost: 2d6).** Roll a d6. Until 
the start of your next turn, you gain a bonus to 
your AC equal to the number rolled.

**Invigorate (Cost: 2d6).** Choose a creature you 
can see within 30 feet of yourself. Until the end 
of that creature’s next turn, whenever it makes 
an attack roll or a saving throw, it can roll a d6 
and add the number rolled to the attack roll or 
saving throw.
\column
### Master Duelist
***Levels**: 17th*

Immediately after you use your Sneak Attack, 
you can make another attack against the same 
target, provided you are within 5 feet of it and no 
other creatures are within 5 feet of you.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Thief
A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer,
you are the consummate adventurer. In addition 
to improving your agility and stealthiness, you 
gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.

### Fast Hands
***Levels**: 3rd*

As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the 
following:
**Sleight of Hand.** Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.
**Use an Object.** Take the Use an Object action, or take the Magic action to use a magic item that requires that action.

### Second-Story Work
***Levels**: 3rd*

You have trained to reach especially hard-toreach places, granting you these benefits:
**Climber.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed. On your turn, you can move on a ceilingwithout making an ability check, provided there is at least one handhold during the move, but you fall if you end the turn there without a handhold.
**Jumper.** Your jump distance is determined by your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

### Supreme Sneak
***Levels**: 9th*

You gain the following Cunning Strike option.

**Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6).** If you have the 
Hide action’s Invisible condition, this attack 
doesn’t end that condition on you if you end the
turn behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total 
Cover.

### Use Magic Device
***Levels**: 13th*

In your treasure hunting, you have learned how 
to maximize use of magic items, granting you the 
following benefits:

**Attunement.** You can attune to up to six magic items at once.<br>
**Charges.** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll a d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.<br>
**Scrolls.** You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your Spellcasting Ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a 1st-level spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

### Thief's Reflexes
***Levels**: 17th*

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly 
escaping danger. You can take two turns during 
the first round of any combat. You take your first 
turn at your normal Initiative and your second 
turn at your Initiative minus 10.
