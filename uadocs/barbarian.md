# Barbarian
<br>

Barbarians are warriors defined by their 
connection to the primal forces of the 
multiverse, which manifests as a Rage. Far more 
than a mere emotion, and not limited to anger or 
fury, a Barbarian’s Rage is an incarnation of a 
predator’s ferocity, a storm’s unrelenting assault, 
and the churning turmoil of the sea.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a 
fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as 
a connection to the pain and anguish of the 
world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or 
as an expression of their own deepest self. For 
every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels 
not just battle prowess but also uncanny reflexes 
and heightened senses.

Some Barbarians are uncomfortable when 
hedged in by walls and crowds, preferring to live 
in regions of unspoiled natural vitality. Others 
cherish the primal forces at work in farmlands 
and recognize the vitality of cities. Barbarians of 
all sorts embrace their place in the multiverse, 
valuing keen instincts and raw physicality.

Even without the power of their Rage, 
Barbarians are skilled in combat and the use of 
weapons. When they do call on their Rage, it 
gives them superhuman strength and resilience. 
It also heightens their senses and reflexes, 
making the Rage useful beyond combat.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and 
leaders in their communities. They charge 
headlong into danger so those who are under 
their protection don’t have to. Their courage in 
the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly 
suited for adventuring.

## Barbarian Class Features
As a Barbarian, you gain the following class features 
when you reach the specified levels in this class. 
These features are listed on the Barbarian table.

### Rage
***Levels**: 1st (see Barbarian Table for higher levels)*

You can imbue yourself with a primal power that 
is called your Rage, a force that grants you 
extraordinary might and resilience. You can 
enter it as a Bonus Action, provided you aren’t 
wearing Heavy Armor.

While active, your Rage has the following 
effects:
**Damage Resistance.** You have resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.<br>
**Rage Damage.** When you make an attack with a weapon using Strength or an Unarmed Strike and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.<br>
**Strength Advantage.** You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.<br>
**No Concentration or Spells.** You can’t maintain Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.

The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, 
and it ends early if you don Heavy Armor or have 
the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still 
active on your next turn, you can extend the 
Rage for another round by doing one or more of 
the following:

• Make an attack roll against an enemy.

• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.

• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the 
end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage 
for up to 10 minutes.

You can enter your Rage the number of times
shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages
column of the Barbarian table. You regain one
expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a
Long Rest. 

### Unarmored Defense
***Levels**: 1st*

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base
Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity and 
Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and 
still gain this benefit

### Weapon Mastery
***Levels**: 1st (see Barbarian Table for higher levels)*

Your training with weapons allows you to use 
the Mastery property of two kinds of Simple or 
Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as 
Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a 
Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and 
change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you 
gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of 
more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon 
Mastery column of the Barbarian table.

### Danger Sense
***Levels**: 2nd*

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t 
as they should be, giving you an edge when you 
dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity 
saving throws, unless you have the Incapacitated
condition.

### Reckless Attack
***Levels**: 2nd*

You can throw aside all concern for defense to 
attack with fierce desperation. When you make 
your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide 
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you 
Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until 
the start of your next turn, but attack rolls 
against you have Advantage during that time.

### Barbarian Subclass *and Features*{color:#D35400}
***Levels**: 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th*

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you 
special abilities at certain Barbarian levels. For 
the rest of your career, you gain each of your 
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian
level and lower.

### Primal Knowledge
***Levels**: 3rd*

You gain proficiency in another skill of your 
choice from the list of skills available to 
Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can 
channel primal power when you attempt certain 
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using 
one of the following skills, you can make it as a 
Strength check even if it normally uses a 
different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, 
Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use 
this ability, your Strength represents primal 
power coursing through you, honing your agility 
and senses.

### Ability Score Improvement
***Levels**: 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 19th*

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Extra Attack
***Levels**: 5th*

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Fast Movement
***Levels**: 5th* 

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy Armor.

### Feral Instinct
***Levels**: 7th*

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

### Instinctive Pounce
***Levels**: 7th*

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter 
your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

### Brutal Strike
***Levels**: 9th*

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo 
Advantage on the next attack roll you make on 
your turn with a Strength-based attack. If that 
attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 
damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or 
Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal 
Strike effect of your choice. You have the 
following effect options.

**Forceful Blow.** The target is pushed 15 feet 
straight away from you. You can then Move up to 
half your Speed straight toward the target 
without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

**Hamstring Blow.** The target’s Speed is 
reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next 
turn.

### Relentless Rage
***Levels**: 11th*

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite 
grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points 
while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, 
you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. 
If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to 
a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, 
the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short 
Rest or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

### *Improved Brutal Strike*
***Levels**: 13th, 17th*

At 13th level, you have honed new ways to attack furiously. 
The following effects are now among your Brutal 
Strike options.

**Staggering Blow.** The target has Disadvantage 
on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t 
make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your 
next turn.

**Sundering Blow.** Your blow leaves an opening 
in the creature’s defense for an ally until the 
start of your next turn. The next attack roll made 
by another creature against the target gains a 
bonus to that roll equal to your Rage Damage.

At 17th level, the extra damage your Brutal Strike deals increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects when you use your Brutal Strike feature.

### Persistent Rage
***Levels**: 15th*

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all
expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of 
Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you 
finish a Long Rest.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now 
lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do 
anything to extend it from round to round. The 
Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious, not 
the Incapacitated, condition or don Heavy 
Armor.

### Indomitable Might
***Levels**: 18th*

If your total for a Strength check or Strength 
saving throw is less than your Strength score, 
you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
***Levels**: 20th*

You embody primal power. Your Strength and 
Constitution scores increase by 4, and their 
maximum is now 26.

## Barbarian Subclasses
A Barbarian Subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Barbarian levels, as specified in the Subclass. 

## Path of the Berserker
For Barbarians who walk the Path of the 
Berserker, their Rage is primarily directed 
toward violence. Their path is one of 
untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of 
battle as they allow their Rage to seize and 
empower them.

### Frenzy
***Levels**: 3rd*

You can go into a frenzy in battle. If you use 
Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you 
deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To 
determine the extra damage, roll a number of 
d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add 
them together. The damage has the same type as 
the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the 
attack.

### Mindless Rage
***Levels**: 6th*

You have immunity to the Charmed and
Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. 
If you’re Charmed or Frightened when you enter 
your Rage, that condition ends on you.

### Retaliation
***Levels**: 10th*

When you take damage from a creature that is 
within 5 feet of you, you can use your Reaction to 
make one melee attack against that creature, 
using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

### Intimidating Presence
***Levels**: 14th*

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into 
others with your menacing presence as you 
swell with primal power. When you do so, each 
creature of your choice within 30 feet of you—or 
60 feet of you if your Rage is active—must make
a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your 
proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), 
provided the creature isn’t behind Total Cover. 
On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened 
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the 
Frightened creature’s turns, the creature repeats 
the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a 
successful save.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again 
until you finish a Long Rest. If you’ve run out of
uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your 
Rage, choosing to activate Intimidating Presence 
instead of Rage.


## Path of the Wild Heart
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild 
Heart view themselves as kin to the animal 
inhabitants of the natural world. They learn 
magical means to connect and communicate 
with animals, and their Rage heightens their 
connection to animals as it fills them with 
supernatural might.

### Animal Speaker
***Levels**: 3rd*

You can cast the Beast Sense and Speak with 
Animals spells, but only as Rituals. Wisdom is 
your spellcasting ability for them.

### Rage of the Wilds
***Levels**: 3rd*

Your Rage taps into the primal power of animals. 
You gain one of the following options of your 
choice. Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you 
can change your choice.

**Bear.** When you activate your Rage, choose 
two damage types, other than Force or Psychic. You have Resistance to the chosen types until the 
Rage ends.

**Eagle.** When you activate your Rage and as a 
Bonus Action while it’s active, you can take both
the Disengage and the Dash action.

**Wolf.** While your Rage is active, your allies 
have Advantage on melee attack rolls against any 
enemy of yours within 10 feet of you.

### Aspect of the Wilds
***Levels**: 6th*

You gain one of the following options of your 
choice. Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you 
can change your choice.

**Elephant.** You gain proficiency in the Athletics 
or Insight skill. If you already have proficiency in 
the skill, you gain Expertise in it instead.

**Owl.** You gain proficiency in the Investigation
or Perception skill. If you already have 
proficiency in the skill, you gain Expertise in it
instead.

**Spider.** You gain proficiency in the Stealth or 
Survival skill. If you already have proficiency in 
the skill, you gain Expertise in it instead.

### Natural Speaker
***Levels**: 10th*

You can cast the Commune with Nature spell, but 
only as a Ritual. Wisdom is your spellcasting 
ability for it.

### Power of the Wilds
***Levels**: 14th*

You gain one of the following options of your 
choice. Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you 
can change your choice.

**Lion.** While your Rage is active, any of your 
enemies within 5 feet of you have Disadvantage

Fly Speed equal to your Speed, provided you 
aren’t wearing any armor.

**Ram.** While your Rage is active, when you hit a 
Large or smaller creature with a melee attack, it 
must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 
equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your 
Strength modifier) or have the Prone condition.

## Path of the World Tree
Barbarians who follow the Path of the World 
Tree believe that their Rage links them to the 
cosmic ash tree Yggdrasil. This “world tree” 
grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them 
to each other and to the many worlds of the 
Material Plane, and the greatest plants on every 
world are said to be distant descendants of 
mighty Yggdrasil. These Barbarians draw on 
their connection to the world tree as a source of 
vitality and as a means of travel across the 
multiverse.

### Vitality of the Tree
***Levels**: 3rd*

Your Rage taps into the lifeforce of the World 
Tree. You gain the following benefits:
**Vitality Surge.** When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Barbarian level. <br>
**Life-Giving Force.** At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain Temporary Hit Points. To determine the number of Temporary Hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when your Rage ends, they vanish.


### Branches of the Tree
***Levels**: 6th*

While your Rage is active, whenever a creature 
you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you, 
you can use your Reaction to summon spectral 
branches of the World Tree around it. The target 
must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 
equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your 
Strength modifier) or be teleported to an 
unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of 
yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you 
can see. The space the target teleports to must 
be on a surface or liquid that can support it; 
otherwise, the target doesn’t teleport.

After the target teleports, you can reduce its 
Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Battering Roots
***Levels**: 10th*

Tendrils of the World Tree extend from your 
Melee weapons. During your turn, while you 
wield a Melee weapon with the Heavy or 
Versatile property, your reach with that weapon 
increases by 10 feet. When you hit with this 
weapon, you can activate the Push or Topple 
property in addition to any other Mastery 
property you are using with that weapon.

### Travel Along the Tree
***Levels**: 14th*

You can briefly travel along the World Tree. 
When you activate your Rage and as a Bonus 
Action while it’s active, you can teleport up to 60 
feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

In addition, when you teleport using this 
feature, you can bring up to six willing creatures 
who are within 10 feet of yourself, and the range 
you can teleport increases to 500 feet. Each 
creature teleports to an unoccupied space of 
your choice within 10 feet of your destination 
space. You can teleport other creatures with you 
only once per Rage.

## Path of the Zealot
For Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot, 
their Rage is not merely a connection to nature; 
it is a gift from a god. These Barbarians often 
experience their Rage as an ecstatic experience 
of union with their gods, infusing them with 
divine power to pursue the gods’ purposes in the 
world. 

### Divine Fury
***Levels**: 3rd*

You can channel divine power into your strikes. 
On each of your turns while your Rage is active, 
the first creature you hit with a weapon or an 
Unarmed Strike takes extra damage equal to 1d6 
plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The 
extra damage is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose 
the type each time you deal the damage.

### Warrior of the Gods
***Levels**: 3rd*

A divine entity helps ensure you can continue to 
fight. When a spell or magic item restores any of 
your Hit Points, you can roll a d12 and regain 
additional Hit Points equal to the number rolled. 
You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 
once), and you regain all expended uses when 
you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, if a spell, such as the Raise Dead
spell, has the sole effect of restoring you to life 
(but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need 
Material 
components to cast the spell on you.

### Fanatical Focus
***Levels**: 6th*

If you fail a saving throw while your Rage is
active, you can reroll it, and you must use the 
new roll. You can use this feature only once per 
active Rage.

### Zealous Presence
***Levels**: 10th*

As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry 
infused with divine energy. Up to ten other 
creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you 
gain Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws 
until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again 
until you finish a Long Rest. If you’ve run out of 
uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your 
Rage to activate Zealous Presence
instead of Rage.

### Rage Beyond Death
***Levels**: 14th*

When your Relentless Rage successfully restores 
your Hit Points, you can assume the form of a 
spectral warrior. While in this form, you gain the 
following benefits: 

* You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain, but you take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.

* When you’re hit by an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to turn that hit into a miss.

The form lasts for 1 minute or until you regain 
any Hit Points or drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you 
use this feature, you can’t do so again until you 
finish a Long Rest.
