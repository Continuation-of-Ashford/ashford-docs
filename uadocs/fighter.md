# Fighter
<br>

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, 
royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened 
mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an 
unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. 
And they are well acquainted with death, both 
meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. 
Every Fighter can swing an axe, fence with a 
rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, and 
use a bow. Fighters master various weapon 
techniques, allowing them to get the best use 
from a wide variety of weapons, and a wellequipped Fighter always has the right tool at 
hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a 
Fighter is adept with shields and every form of 
armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, 
each Fighter specializes in certain styles of 
combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on 
fighting with two weapons at once, and some on 
augmenting their martial skills with magic. This 
combination of broad general ability and 
extensive specialization makes Fighters superior 
combatants everywhere.

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and 
other dangerous work common among 
adventurers is second nature for a Fighter. There 
are great risks but also great rewards: gold, 
magic weaponry, and glory.

Fighting Style feat (written below).

### Second Wind
***Levels**: 1st (see Fighter Table for higher levels)*

You have a limited well of physical and mental 
stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, 
you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 + your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one 
expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and 
you regain all expended uses when you finish a 
Long Rest.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you 
gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the 
Second Wind column of the Fighter table.

### Weapon Mastery
***Levels**: 1st (see Fighter Table for higher levels)*

Your training with weapons allows you to use 
the Mastery property of three kinds of Simple or 
Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you 
finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon 
drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you 
gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of 
more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon 
Mastery column of the Fighter table.

### Action Surge
***Levels**: 2nd, 17th*

You can push yourself beyond your normal 
limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take 
one additional action, except the Magic action.

Short Rest or Long Rest before you can use it 
again. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice 
before a rest but only once on a turn.

### Tactical Mind
***Levels**: 2nd*

You have a mind for tactics and getting the upper 
hand on and off the battlefield. When you fail an 
ability check, you can expend a use of your 
Second Wind to push yourself toward success. 
Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10
and add the number rolled to the ability check, 
potentially turning it into a success. If the check 
still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

### Fighter Subclass and Features
***Levels**: 3rd, 7th, 15th, 18th*

You gain *a Fighter subclass of your choice, such as: Champion.*{color:#D35400}  
*UA Subclasses are detailed after this class’s  description.*{color:#D35400} 

A subclass is a specialization that grants you 
special abilities at certain Fighter levels. For 
the rest of your career, you gain each of your 
subclass’s features that are of your Fighter
level and lower.

### Ability Score Improvement
***Levels**: 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 19th*

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Tactical Shift
***Levels**: 5th*

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a 
Bonus Action, you can move up to half your 
Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

### Indomitable
***Levels**: 9th, 13th, 17th*

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a 
bonus equal to your Fighter level. If you do so, 
you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this 
feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice between Long 
Rests starting at level 13 and three times 
between Long Rests starting at level 17.

### Master of Armaments
***Levels**: 9th*

You are a master of weapons. Whenever you 
finish a Long Rest, you can choose any of the 
kinds of Mastery weapons you’re using and 
replace the Mastery property of each with 
another Mastery property. The chosen kind of 
weapon must qualify for the new property. For 
example, you could replace the Longsword’s Sap
property with the Push property.

These property changes apply only for you, not 
for others, and the changes end for you when 
you finish your next Long Rest.

### Two Extra Attacks
***Levels**: 11th*

Your Extra Attack feature now confers two extra attacks rather than one.

### Studied Attacks
***Levels**: 13th*

from each attack you make. If you make an 
attack roll against a creature and miss, you have 
Advantage on your next attack roll against that 
creature before the end of your next turn.

### Three Extra Attacks
***Levels**: 20th*

Your Extra Attack feature now confers three extra attacks rather than two.

## Fighter Subclasses

## Battle Master
Battle Masters are students of the art of battle, 
learning martial techniques passed down 
through generations. The most accomplished 
Battle Masters are well-rounded figures who 
combine their carefully honed combat skills with 
academic study in the fields of history, theory, 
and the arts.

### Combat Superiority
***Levels**: 3rd*

Your experience on the battlefield has honed 
your fighting techniques. You learn Maneuvers 
that are fueled by special dice called Superiority 
Dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three different
Maneuvers of your choice from the “Maneuvers 
Options” section later in this subclass’s 
description. Many Maneuvers enhance an attack 
in some way. You can use only one Maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional Maneuvers of your 
choice when you reach Fighter level 7, 10, and 
15. Each time you learn new Maneuvers, you can 
also replace one Maneuver you know with a 
different one.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four Superiority 
Dice, which are d8s. A Superiority Die is 
expended when you use it. You regain all 
expended Superiority Dice when you finish a 
Short Rest or Long Rest.

You gain an additional Superiority Die when 
you reach Fighter level 7 (five dice total) and 15
(six dice total).

**Saving Throws.** If a Maneuver requires a 
saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency 
Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier 
(your choice).

strengths and weaknesses of a creature you can

that creature has any damage immunities, 
resistances, or vulnerabilities, and if the creature 
has any, you know what they are.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again 
until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore 
a use of the feature by expending one Superiority 
Die (no action required).


### Improved Combat Superiority
***Levels**: 10th*

Your Superiority Die becomes a d10.

### Relentless
***Levels**: 15th*

## Eldritch Knight
Eldritch Knights combine the martial mastery 
common to all Fighters with a careful study of 
magic. Their spells both complement and extend 
their combat skills, providing additional 
protection to shore up their armor and also 
allowing them to engage many foes at once with 
explosive magic. 

### Spellcasting
***Levels**: 3rd 

You have learned to cast spells. See the <s>Player’s Handbook</s> *Spellcasting chapter*{color:#D35400} for rules on spellcasting. The 
information below details how you use those 
rules as an Eldritch Knight.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your 
choice from the Wizard spell list. Whenever you 
gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of this 
feature’s cantrips with another cantrip of your 
choice from the Wizard spell list.

When you reach level 10 in this class, you 
learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

**Spell Slots.** . The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting 
table shows how many spell slots you have to 
cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one 
of these spells, you must expend a slot of the 
spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended 
spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare a list 
of spells of level 1 and higher that are available 
for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose 
three level 1 spells from the Wizard spell list, 
two of which must be from the Abjuration and 
Evocation schools of magic.

The number of spells on your list increases as 
you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared 
Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting 
table. Whenever that number increases, choose 
additional spells from the Wizard spell list until 
the number of spells on your list matches the 
number on the table. The chosen spells must be 
of a level for which you have spell slots. For 
example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of 
prepared spells can include six Wizard spells of 
levels 1 and 2, in any combination.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever
you gain a level in this class, you can replace one 
of the spells you know with another spell of your 
choice from the Wizard spell list. The new spell 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your 
spellcasting ability for your Eldritch Knight 
spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane 
Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you 
prepare for this subclass.

### War Bond
***Levels**: 3rd*

You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond 
between yourself and one weapon. You perform 
the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be 
done during a Short Rest. The weapon must be 
within your reach throughout the ritual, at the 
conclusion of which you touch the weapon and 
forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, 
you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you 
have the Incapacitated condition. If it is on the 
same plane of existence, you can summon that 
weapon as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport 
instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but 
can summon only one at a time with your Bonus 
Action. If you attempt to bond with a third 
weapon, you must break the bond with one of 
the other two.
