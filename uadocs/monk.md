# Monk
<br>

Monks use rigorous combat training and mental 
discipline to align themselves with the 
multiverse and tap into internal reservoirs of 
power. Different Monks conceptualize this 
power in various ways: as breath, energy, life 
force, essence, or self, for example. Whether 
channeled as a striking display of martial 
prowess or as a subtler focus of defense and 
speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks harness and focus their internal power 
to create extraordinary, even supernatural, 
effects. They channel uncanny speed and 
strength into their attacks, with or without the 
use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the 
most basic weapons can become sophisticated 
implements of combat mastery. A Monk’s
mightiest attacks can stun their opponents.

Many Monks find that a structured life of 
ascetic withdrawal from the mundane world 
helps them cultivate the physical and mental 
discipline they need to harness their power. 
Other Monks believe that immersing themselves 
in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their 
determination and discipline.  

Monks generally view their adventures as 
personal tests of their physical and mental 
development. They are driven by a desire to 
accomplish a greater mission than merely 
slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they 
strive to hone themselves into living weapons.

## Monk Class Features
As a Monk, you gain the following class features 
when you reach the specified levels in this class. 
These features are listed on the Monk table.

### Martial Arts
***Levels**: 1st (see Monk Table for higher levels)*

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and Monk Weapons, which are the following:

• Simple Melee Weapons

• Martial Weapons that have the Light property

You gain the following benefits while you are 
unarmed or wielding only Monk Weapons and 
you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

**Bonus Unarmed Strike.**  You can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.<br>
**Dexterous Attacks.**  You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk Weapons. In addition, when you choose the Grapple or Shove option, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength to determine the saving throw DC.<br>
**Martial Arts Die.**  You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or Monk Weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.<br>

### Unarmored Defense
***Levels**: 1st*

While you aren’t wearing any armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

### Monk's Discipline
***Levels**: 2nd*

Your self-discipline and martial training allow 
you to harness a well of extraordinary energy 
within yourself. Your access to this energy is 
represented by a number of Discipline Points. 
Your Monk level determines the number of 
points you have, as shown in the Discipline 
Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel certain
Monk features. You start knowing three such 
features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and 
Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed 
below.

When you spend a Discipline Point, it is 
unavailable until you finish a Short Rest or Long 
Rest, at the end of which you regain all your 
expended points.

Some features that use Discipline Points
require your target to make a saving throw. The 
saving throw DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency 
Bonus plus your Wisdom modifier.

**Flurry of Blows.** You can spend 1 Discipline Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.

**Patient Defense.** You can take the Disengage
action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus 
Action.

**Step of the Wind.** You can take the Dash action 
as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to take both the Disengage and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Uncanny Metabolism
***Levels**: 2nd*

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all 
expended Discipline Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Unarmored Movement
***Levels**: 2nd*

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the Monk table.

### Deflect Attacks
***Levels**: 2nd*

You can use your Reaction to deflect melee and 
ranged attacks against you that deal 
Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage. 
When you do so, the total damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier plus your Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature within 5 feet of you if the attack was a melee attack or 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or 
take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

### Monk Subclass *and Features*{color:#D35400}
***Levels**: 3rd, 6th, 11th, 17th*

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice, such as
Warrior of Mercy, Warrior of Shadow, Warrior of
the Four Elements, or Warrior of the Open Hand. 
UA Subclasses are detailed after this class’s 
description (for this playtest, use Way of Mercy
from Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything for Warrior 
of Mercy). 

A subclass is a specialization that grants you 
special abilities at certain Monk levels. For the 
rest of your career, you gain each of your 
subclass’s features that are of your Monk level 
and lower.

### Ability Score Improvement
***Levels**: 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 19th*

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Slow Fall
***Levels**: 4th*

You can use your Reaction when you fall to 
reduce any damage you take from the fall by an 
amount equal to five times your Monk level.

### Extra Attack
***Levels**: 5th*

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Strike
***Levels**: 5th* 

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a 
Monk Weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can 
spend 1 Discipline Point to attempt a stunning 
strike. The target must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the 
Stunned condition until the start of your next 
turn. On a successful save, the target takes Force 
damage equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die 
plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Empowered Strikes
***Levels**: 6th*

Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed 
Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or 
its normal damage type.

### Evasion
***Levels**: 7th*

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.

### Acrobatic Movement
***Levels**: 9th*

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a 
Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical 
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without 
falling during the movement.

### Heightened Discipline
***Levels**: 10th*

Your training has pushed your body and mind to 
new levels. Your Flurry of Blows, Patient 
Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following 
benefits:
**Flurry of Blows.**  You can spend 1 Discipline Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three Unarmed Strikes with it instead of two.<br>
**Patient Defense.**  When you spend a Discipline Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.<br>
**Step of the Wind.**  When you spend a Discipline Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of you that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.

### Self-Restoration
***Levels**: 10th*

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned.

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t 
give you levels of Exhaustion.

### Deflect Energy
***Levels**: 13th*

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature 
against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

### Disciplined Survivor
***Levels**: 14th*
Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving 
throw and fail, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to reroll it and take the second result.

### Perfect Discipline
***Levels**: 15th*

When you roll Initiative and have 3 Discipline Points or fewer, you regain expended Discipline Points until you have 4.

### Superior Defense
***Levels**: 18th*

At the start of your turn, you can spend 3 
Discipline Points to perfectly bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have resistance to all damage except Force damage.

### Body and Mind
***Levels**: 20th*

You have honed your body and mind to new 
heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores 
increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 26.

## Monk Subclasses
A Monk subclass is a specialization that grants 
you special abilities at certain levels, as specified 
in the subclass. This section presents three 
subclasses: Warrior of Shadow, Warrior of the 
Elements, and Warrior of the Hand. 

## Warrior of Shadow
Warriors of Shadow practice stealth and 
subterfuge, channeling their reservoirs of power 
to harness the power of the Shadowfell. They are 
at home in darkness, able to draw gloom around 
themselves to hide, to leap from shadow to 
shadow, and even to take on a wraithlike form of 
living shadow.

### Shadow Arts
***Levels**: 3rd*

Through rigorous training, you have learned to 
draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the 
following benefits:
**Darkness.**  You can spend 1 Discipline Point to cast the Darkness spell without any spell components. You can see within the spell’s area when you cast it with this feature. While the spell persists, you can move its area of darkness to a space within 60 feet of you at the start of each of your turns.<br>
**Darkvision.**  You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.
**Shadowy Figments.**  You know the Minor Illusion cantrip and use Wisdom as the spellcasting ability for it.

### Shadow Step
***Levels**: 6th*

While entirely within Dim Light or Darkness, you 
can use a Bonus Action to teleport up to 60 feet 
to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in 
Dim Light or Darkness. You then have Advantage 
on the next melee attack you make before the 
end of the turn

### Improved Shadow Step
***Levels**: 11th*

You can draw on your connection to shadow to 
empower your teleportation. When you use your 
Shadow Step, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to 
remove the requirement that you must start and 
end in Dim Light or Darkness for that use of the 
feature. As part of this Bonus Action, you can 
make an Unarmed Strike immediately after the 
teleportation.

### Cloak of Shadows
***Levels**: 17th*

As a Bonus Action while entirely within Dim 
Light or Darkness, you can spend 3 Discipline 
Points to shroud yourself with magical darkness 
for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated
condition, or until you end your turn in Bright 
Light. While shrouded in darkness, you gain the 
following benefits:
**Invisibility.**  You have the Invisible condition.<br>
**Partially Incorporeal.**  You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.<br>
**Shadow Flurry.**  You can use your Flurry of Blows without spending any Discipline Points.

## Warrior of the Elements
The tradition of the Four Elements encompasses 
Monks who tap into the power of the Elemental 
Planes through their practice of martial arts. 
Some of these Monks focus on a single element, 
learning to wreathe their fists in fire and cause 
explosive bursts of flame, or to wield mighty 
gusts of icy wind. Others weave the elements 
together and learn a variety of techniques to 
harness the appropriate elemental force for each 
particular circumstance.

### Elemental Attunement
***Levels**: 3rd*

You have attuned yourself with the elemental 
forces of the multiverse. You know the 
Elementalism cantrip (detailed below).
In addition, at the start of your turn, you can 
spend 1 Discipline Point to imbue yourself with 
elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 
minutes or until you have the Incapacitated
condition. You gain the following benefits for the 
duration:
**Elemental Strikes.**  Whenever you hit with your Unarmed Strike, you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning damage rather than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with your Unarmed Strike, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.
**Reach.**  When you make an Unarmed Strike, your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.

### Enviromental Burst
***Levels**: 6th*

As a Magic action, you can spend 2 Discipline 
Points to cause environmental energy to burst in 
a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point 
within 120 feet of yourself. Choose a damage 
type: Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning.

Each creature in the sphere must make a 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes damage of the chosen type equal 
to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. On a 
successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage.

Before or after you take this action, you can 
make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

### Stride of the Elements

When you use the Elemental Attunement feature, 
you also gain the following benefits for the 
duration:
**Damage Resistance.**  You gain resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning. At the start of each of your turns, you can change this choice.<br>
**Destructive Stride.**  When you use your Step of the Wind, your Speed increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn. For that duration, any creature of your choice takes damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you enter a space within 5 feet of it. The damage is the same type you chose for this feature’s damage resistance. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.<br>
**Empowered Strikes.**  Once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you hit it with an Unarmed Strike. The damage is the same type you chose for this feature’s damage resistance.

## Warrior of the Hand

Warriors of the Hand are masters of unarmed 
combat. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own 
energy to protect themselves from harm.


### Open Hand Technique
***Levels**: 3rd*

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack 
granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
**Addle.**  The target can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.<br>
**Push.**  The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you push it up to 15 feet away from yourself.<br>
**Topple.**  The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Prone condition.

### Wholeness of Body
***Levels**: 6th*

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point regained).

You can use this feature a number of times 
equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 
once), and you regain all expended uses when 
you finish a Long Rest. 

### Fleet Step
***Levels**: 11th*

You can easily stride out of harm’s way. When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind as part of that Bonus Action.

### Quivering Palm
***Levels**: 17th*

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can spend 4 Discipline Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with this 
action. To use this action, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the 
effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
