# Beyond Level 20: Prestige
## Work in Progress, please ignore for now.

As a character of legendary reputation and renown - be it fame or infamy - your adventures do not stop there. This feature is available only to level 20 characters and these benefits can be taken once every three sessions of an applicable bracket. Any sessions considered 'arena sessions' are exempt from this and as such will not count, nor do your sessions towards a legendary item search. If you were level 20 before this feature was introduced you do not get to use it retroactively, downtime-wise. This is passive - but must be done during a downtime, and only then - and therefore not a downtime activity. Downtimes earned by `@Dungeon Masters` are applicable. You cannot stack boons, blessings or use Alternatives to Epic Boons.

**Boon of High Magic**

Modification: If you have the Spellcasting class feature, you gain 1 additional spell slot of the highest spell-slot level you have. If you have the Mystic Arcanum feature, you gain 1 additional use of the highest Mystic Arcanum you have. If you have both, you choose which one you get, you can only get this boon once.

**EXP Exchange**
| Amount  | Result                      |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| 55,000  | Receive 1 [Blessing](blessings.md). ASI received from these are allowed.          |
| 100,000 | Receive an additional Feat. Feats taken in this way do not grant ASI. OR you can increase an ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1. This can only be taken if you chose a feat instead of an ASI during the leveling process.|
| 120,000 | Receive 1 [Boon](boons.md).             |
