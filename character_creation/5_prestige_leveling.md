# Ashford Prestige Leveling
Here in the Ashford server, characters aren't finished when they hit level 20. If you played a character that much to bring them to that level, you probably really enjoy that character and want to continue to play them. But that means you'd be getting XP that you couldn't do anything with.

We want you to continue to feel rewarded and to look forward to play the character we've all grown familiar with as much as you want. In order to keep XP feeling like a worthwhile reward, while at the same time helping DMs not over-use the Blessings and Boons as high-level rewards, Ashford characters of level 20 can pursue a Prestige Class.

These prestige classes are homebrew classes with 5 levels. Similar to how multi-classing works, you choose one and gain levels in it. What is not similar is that these prestige classes have prerequisites. Dissimilar is that once you have chosen a prestige class, you cannot take levels in another prestige class.

Legendary Hero is the *"legendary version of your class"* variant. It is broadly the best mechanical option for every class, without changing the flavor of your character. If you just want to be better at what your level 20 character is good at, then choose Legendary Hero. 

Other prestige options seek power that comes from outside sources, such as becoming a werewolf or embracing demonic corruption. These represent either a new focus of power for your character or a specialization into one aspect of them. They will present new and different powers to use that give you more options outside of your core class features.

## Leveling Past 20

| Level    | XP Requirement   | PB |
|:--------:|----------:|:---:|
| Prestige | 450,000   | +7 |
| 22       | 600,000   | +7 |
| 23       | 805,000   | +7 |
| 24       | 1,100,000 | +7 |
| 25       | 1,500,000 | +8 |

You can reach up to 25th level when you acquire an amount of XP detailed on the table above.

Abilities that scale solely off of character level (i.e. cantrip damage, a Dragonborn's breath weapon) scale again at 23rd level.

When a prestige class allows you to take a boon or blessing, you can pick from the list on this wiki.
