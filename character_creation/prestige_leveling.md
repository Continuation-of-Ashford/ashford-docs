# Ashford Prestige Leveling
Here in the Ashford server, characters aren't finished when they hit level 20. If you played a character that much to bring them to that level, you probably really enjoy that character and want to continue to play them. But that means you'd be getting XP that you couldn't do anything with.

We want you to continue to feel rewarded and to look forward to play the character we've all grown familiar with as much as you want. In order to keep XP feeling like a worthwhile reward, while at the same time helping DMs not over-use the Blessings and Boons as high-level rewards. Ashford characters of level 20 can pursue a Prestige Class.

These prestige classes are homebrew classes with 5 levels. Similar to how multiclassing works, you choose one and gain levels in it. What is not similar, is that these prestige classes have prerequisites. There prerequisites are there to prevent multi-classing into multiple prestige classes, while also demanding that the character actually be prestigious enough to earn the class.

## Legendary Hero
*Many adventurers seek to become renowned in bardic tales. An over enthusiastic few will hire hype man as soon as they start their first adventure. But a true legend is forged by deeds that are considered impossible. A hero of legend, isn't merely heroic, they are capable beyond belief. A true legend is a warrior, mage or trickster so skilled they can impress the gods, and is feared by man and demon alike.*

| Level    | XP Cost   | PB | Features |
|:--------:|----------:|---:|:---------|
| Prestige | 450,000   | +7 | Legendary Skill, Immortality? |
| 22       | 600,000   | +7 | Blessing |
| 23       | 805,000   | +7 | Ability Score improvement	|
| 24       | 1,100,000 | +7 | Boon |
| 25       | 1,500,000 | +8 | Legendary resistance (1/day) |

		
### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that is able to use downtimes.   
Meaning you cannot choose this prestige class during character creation, because downtimes only become available after playing at least 1 session with the character.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** 1 saving throw you are not already proficient in
- **Skills:** 1 skill you are not already proficient in

### Legendary Skill					
At 21st level, as a Legendary Hero you gain the skill and saving throw proficiencies listed above.   
In addition *your prowess at one particular skill becomes renowned for your impossible feats,* pick one skill you already had proficiency in. You gain expertise in that skill. Adding double your proficiency bonus to any Ability Checks that include that proficiency.

### Immortality?
A Legendary Hero has performed deeds worthy of legend. *Their legend, will last forever. As the legend is retold and spreads it strengthens the hero's legacy for each person that hears it.*   
If the caster of Resurrection or True Resurrection knows your legend, they don't need your soul to resurrect you, because the spell is able to forge a new soul based on your legend. A caster that knows your legend also ignores how long you have been dead or undead when resurrecting you.

### Blessing					
At 22nd level, you gain a [blessing](blessings.md). Some blessings are named who they came from, other blessings are most often bestowed by the Celestials. But your Blessings might come from other sources, such as Fey, Fiends, Titans(giants) or Primordials(elementals). 

When you gain this feature choose where your blessing came from. 

After you reveal the source of you blessing to a creature, you have advantage on Charisma(persuasion) checks if its creature types matches the source of your blessing, or Charisma(intimidation) checks if its creature type matches one of the others in this feature.

### Mythic Ability Score improvement

## Dread Lich
*Those that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. Others find the lore elsewhere, hidden within Vecna's cursed memoirs.*

*Those that can bestow immortality always demand a heavy toll for this secret knowledge. Often including the memories of how lichdom is achieved.*

| Level    | XP Cost   | PB | Features |

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character capable of casting the Imprisonment spell. 

In order to become a lich you must bargain for the secret rituals with a being of great evil, then sacrifice and consume the soul of another sentient creature. So while there is no Alignment prerequisite for starting the path to Lichdom, successfully completing the steps will always alter your alignment to Evil. Even if you started on this path with the intention to use the power for the good of others.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

### Phylactery		
At 21st level, you perform a ritual to kill your living body and trap your soul within a phylactery. You are now an object.   
*A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.* Your phylactery when finished contains 2 trapped souls, one of which is your own.    
Once per day you can use your phylactery as a component in the Imprisonment spell, but only if the target is humanoid. When used this way, the spell's effect is similar to the Minimus Containment option. After 24 hours in the phylactery, the imprisoned creature's body is destroyed and their soul becomes trapped in your phylactery. 

You can use souls trapped in your phylactery to do the following:

**Rejuvenation A**    
If your soul is not in control of a body, you can expend 1 soul from your phylactery to magically create a copy of your original body, within 5ft of your phylactery. After 1d10 days this new body rises as an undead and your soul takes control of it. (while remaining in the phylactery)

The new body inherits all of your stats and class features; It is you, but undead. Your equipment and magic items (including tattoos) are left behind on your old body. 

**Rejuvenation B**     
If you are in control of a body, you can expend 1 soul from your phylactery to rejuvenate that body to appear healthy and alive, to any forms non-magical perception. If you take measures to preserve your body, you can delay any perceivable decay for a month. 

**Degradation to Demilich**     
If you don't have a body for over 10 days, but the only soul remaining in your phylactery is your own, you must expend your own soul to create a Demilich. This newly created undead has your memories, but is not under your control. Your character is gone and only destroying the phylactery and then using Divine Intervention to bring back the soul can restore them. 

### Undead Resilience					
At 22nd level, your undead form is refined, removing the weaknesses mortals have. You do not need to breathe, you do not require food, drink, or sleep. You become immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and you are resistant to necrotic damage.

### Unholy Ability Score improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Unholy Blessing					
At 24nd level, choose either Orcus or Vecna as your patron. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that your patron grants you. 

You also gain advantage on saving throws against any effects that turn undead as well as on Charisma checks you make while speaking to undead creatures.

				
### Paralyzing Touch					
At 25th level, *your soul's control over flesh and bone becomes able to disrupt the control others have over their body*.    
As an Action you can make a Melee Spell Attack at a creature within 5ft. On a hit you deal 2d6 cold and 2d6 necrotic damage to the target and they must make a Constitution save versus your Spell DC or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If you perform this ritual on desecrated ground, it fails and you must wait until your next long rest to try again.

### Healing Touch

### Angelic Form
At 25th level, you also become resistant to fire and radiant damage and immune to the fear condition. 

You also grow a pair of angelic wings, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use a bonus action to hide or manifest the wings. If you already had wings, this extra pair will appear behind your original and increases your existing flying speed by 10 feet.

___

## Corrupted Champion
*Mortals can become tainted by the lower planes when they bargain with devils for power or when they are exposed to the effects of demonic corruption.

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that can cast spells from the Illusion school at 4th level or higher and is affected by at least 1 long-term or indefinite madness effect.

levels in this prestige class, each count as madnesses. So if you ever recover from the prerequisite madness, after gaining a level in this prestige class you automatically meet the prerequisite to gain more.

##### Hit Points

### Illusion of a Boon

### Life's Illusion
At 22nd level, Once per session, when you die, you can choose for it to be a magical trick. *in fact, you only seemed to die. Your enemy killed a perfect illusion of you, while you stood at a safe distance.* Choose a space you can see that is exactly 50ft from where you died, the real you is in that space and you have full hit points. The illusion of the dead you then disappears.

As a reaction, when you are targeted by an attack or a spell by a creature you can see, you cause the creature that targeted you to become magically distracted. If the distracted creature does not have Truesight, you disappear. You reappear at a point you can see within 20 feet (essentially a teleport, but it ignores effects that prevent dimensional travel)

If your new position would mean you are no longer a target of the triggering action, that action fails to complete. The distracted creature spends the Action, Legendary Action, Reaction or Bonus Action it used to target you, doing nothing. (Effectively this is like Counterspell, but it works on non-spells)

You can use this ability once, and regain use of it at the end of a long rest.

### Never Really There
At 25th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.
