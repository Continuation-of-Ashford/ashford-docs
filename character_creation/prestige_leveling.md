# Ashford Prestige Leveling
Here in the Ashford server, characters aren't finished when they hit level 20. If you played a character that much to bring them to that level, you probably really enjoy that character and want to continue to play them. But that means you'd be getting XP that you couldn't do anything with.

We want you to continue to feel rewarded and to look forward to play the character we've all grown familiar with as much as you want. In order to keep XP feeling like a worthwhile reward, while at the same time helping DMs not over-use the Blessings and Boons as high-level rewards. Ashford characters of level 20 can pursue a Prestige Class.

These prestige classes are homebrew classes with 5 levels. Similar to how multi-classing works, you choose one and gain levels in it. What is not similar is that these prestige classes have prerequisites. There prerequisites are there to prevent multi-classing into multiple prestige classes while also demanding that the character actually do something prestigious to earn their class.  If you desire a specific prestige class but do not reach its prerequisites, you are not required to level up to 21 until you do.

Legendary Hero is the *"legendary version of your class"* variant. It is broadly the best mechanical option for every class, without changing the flavor of your character. If you just want to be better at what your level 20 character is good at, then choose Legendary Hero. 

Other prestige options seek power that comes from outside sources, such as becoming a werewolf or embracing demonic corruption. These represent either a new focus of power for your character or a specialization into one aspect of them. They will present new and different powers to use that give you more options outside of your core class features.

### Boons and Blessings
When a prestige class allows you to take a boon or blessing, you can pick from the list on this wiki.

## Legendary Hero
*Many adventurers seek to become renowned in bardic tales. An over enthusiastic few will hire hype men as soon as they start their first adventure. But a true legend is forged by deeds that are considered impossible. A hero of legend isn't merely heroic, they are capable beyond of feats beyond belief. A true legend is a warrior, mage or trickster so skilled they can impress the gods, and is feared by man and demon alike. These figures of legend are the absolute pinacle of what is achievable by a mortal of their specialization.*

### Blessing					
At 22nd level, you gain a [blessing](blessings.md). Some blessings are named who they came from. Unnamed blessings are most often bestowed by Celestials, but your Blessings might come from other sources, such as Fey, Fiends, Titans(giants) or Primordials(elementals).

## Dread Lich
*Those that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. Others find the lore elsewhere, hidden within Vecna's cursed memoirs.*

*Those that can bestow immortality always demand a heavy toll for this secret knowledge. Often including the memories of how lichdom is achieved.*

| Level    | XP Requirement   | PB | Features |
|:--------:|----------:|---:|:---------|
| Prestige | 450,000   | +7 | Phylactery |

| 25       | 1,500,000 | +8 | Paralyzing Touch |

		
### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character capable of casting the Imprisonment spell. 

In order to become a lich you must bargain for the secret rituals with a being of great evil, then sacrifice and consume the soul of another sentient creature. While there is no Alignment prerequisite for starting the path to Lichdom, successfully completing the steps will always alter your alignment to Evil (even if you started on this path with the intention to use the power for the good of others.)

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** none
- **Skills:** none

### Phylactery		
At 21st level, you perform a ritual to kill your living body and trap your soul within a phylactery. You are now an object.   
*A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.* Your phylactery contains 2 trapped souls when finished, one of which is your own.    
Once per day you can use your phylactery as a component in the Imprisonment spell, but only if the target is a humanoid. When used this way, the spell's effect is similar to the Minimus Containment option. After 24 hours in the phylactery, the imprisoned creature's body is destroyed and their soul becomes trapped in your phylactery. 

You can use souls trapped in your phylactery to do the following:

**Rejuvenation A**    
If your soul is not in control of a body, you can expend 1 soul from your phylactery to magically create a copy of your original body, within 5ft of your phylactery. After 1d10 days this new body rises as an undead and your soul takes control of it. (while remaining in the phylactery)

The new body inherits all of your stats and class features; it is you, but undead. Your equipment and magic items (including tattoos) are left behind on your old body. 

**Rejuvenation B**     
If you are in control of a body, you can expend 1 soul from your phylactery to rejuvenate that body to appear healthy and alive, to any forms of non-magical perception. If you take measures to preserve your body, you can delay any perceivable decay for a month. 

**Degradation to Demilich**     
If you don't have a body for over 10 days, but the only soul remaining in your phylactery is your own, you must expend your own soul to create a Demilich. This newly created undead has your memories, but is not under your control. Your character is gone and only destroying the phylactery and then using Divine Intervention to bring back the soul can restore them. 

### Undead Resilience					
At 22nd level, your undead form is refined, removing the weaknesses mortals have. You do not need to breathe and you do not require food, drink, or sleep. You become resistant to necrotic and lightning damage, and immune to poison damage and the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.

### Unholy Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Unholy Blessing					
At 24nd level, choose either Orcus or Vecna as your patron. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that your patron grants you. 

You also gain advantage on saving throws against any effects that turn undead as well as on Charisma checks you make while interacting with undead creatures.

				
### Paralyzing Touch					
At 25th level, *your soul's control over flesh and bone becomes able to disrupt the control others have over their body*.    
As an Action you can make a Melee Spell Attack at a creature within 5ft. On a hit you deal 2d6 cold and 2d6 necrotic damage to the target and they must make a Constitution save versus your Spell DC or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

___

- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

### Endless Worship				
Also at 21st level, *Your devotion to your patron can sustain you while you worship them*. At the end of each long rest you can perform a ritual of worship. When you do so, for the next 24 hours you are immune to the frightened condition, no longer need food or water, you pause your aging, and you can't be aged magically. If you perform this ritual on desecrated ground, it fails and you must wait until your next long rest to try again.

### Healing Touch
At 22nd level, *your touch can extend the benevolence of your god to fill others with vigor and life*. As an Action you can touch a creature other than yourself, the target magically regains 4d8 hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

You can use your Healing Touch a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Divine Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.

At 24th level, *your attacks become shrouded in a sheath of divine light, as the power of your deity radiates out from your hands*. When you deal damage by hitting with an attack roll, for a weapon attack or spell attack, that attack deals 1d6 additional radiant damage.

### Angelic Form
At 25th level, you also become resistant to fire and radiant damage. 

You also grow a pair of angelic wings, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use a bonus action to hide or manifest the wings. Any armor or clothing you wear must be designed to accomodate the wings or be torn apart when the wings are summoned. If you already had wings, this extra pair will appear behind your original and increases your existing flying speed by 10 feet.

___

## Corrupted Champion
*Mortals can become tainted by the lower planes when they bargain with devils for power or when they are exposed to the effects of demonic corruption.

They believe they'll be able to resist the influence of the lower planes, and gain great power.*

Using the Activate Magic Item action your Artifact body allows you to reproduce the effects of several 1st and 2nd level spells. You cast 3 spells at once, from the list below. This does not require any spell slots and does not require concentration. Spells you cast in this way can only affect yourself.

| 1st level spells | 2nd level spells | 
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| 1st Comprehend Languages | 2nd Darkvision       | 
| 1st Expeditious Retreat  | 2nd Enhance Ability  |
| 1st Zephyr Strike        | 2nd Levitate         |
| 1st Jump                 | 2nd See Invisibility |
| 1st Longstrider          | 2nd Spider Climb     |

When you use this feature again, any lingering effects of the previous spells you cast this way end.

### Craftable Boon
At 22nd level, you upgrade your body to incorporate a [boon](boons.md).

You can spend 1 downtime and a rare magic item component to swap this boon for a different boon. 

### Artifact Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1 by weaving additional powerful effects into your body. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Invulnerable Anatomy
At 24th level, *you have replaced enough of your organs to no longer have any that are considered 'vital'.* Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit and you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned and diseased conditions. You still can, but don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.

### You V.2
At 25th level, *building on everything you've learned from overhauling your body the first time, there is still so much room for further improvements!* You upgrade each magic item within your body to a more efficient version. Gaining multiple benefits:

- You gain the Tough feat
- You can attune to 1 additional item
- For each unused attunement slot you you possess you gain a +1 bonus to AC and Saving throws.

## Paths of Power
*Do not be fooled that the schools of magic, that wizards so love to categorize spells into, are the be-all-end-all of magic. Genies have been perfecting their own magic for millennia before some Netherese bookworm even learned to read. Paths of power require endurance and dedication, as well as a gifted teacher to master. But can teach magic without any required reading.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:
Any level 20 Ashford character that manages to find a teacher for a path of their choice.

> Such sages are powerful and ancient extraplanar creatures, the kind that could grant a warlock pact. But you aren't looking for a pact, you want to follow the exact path they took to become powerful.
> 
> Usually this requires you to supplicate yourself to such a creature to gain access to their planar domain.   
> However in the continent of Zakhara there exists secret schools where elementalists emulate the lives of former elemental princes. Usually such schools will require you swear loyalty to their cause, in order to receive their teachings. 

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** none
- **Skills:** none

## Step onto the Path
At 21st level, you move away from the traditional theories of magic and develop a different understanding.

> The elemental planes and Elemental Chaos (including the many para-elemental planes where elements mix together) can be subdivided into provinces.    
> Any path through such a *"province"* could seek its center, mastering the pure form of an element. Alternatively, a path could also visit the borders, mastering how to combine an element with others.

| Province | Path to Power    | Damage Type  |
|:--------:|:-----------------|:------------:|
| Bone | Eternal youth and strength | Necrotic | 
| Flame| [Brotherhood of the True Flame](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_True_Flame) | Fire  | 
| Flame | Fire and light to see clearly and provide insight | Radiant |
| Flame | Protection of the Efreeti and controlling elementals | Fire | 
| Sand | Sandman's path, inducing sleep and stillness | Cold |
| Sand | Glassblower's path, using heat for transmutation | Fire |
| Sand | Protection of the Dao and controlling elementals | Acid |
| Sea | Using fog, water and ice to distract and attack | Cold  |
| Sea | Protection of the Marid and controlling elementals | Cold |
| Wind | Manipulating winds, air, sound and visibility | Thunder  |
| Wind | Protection of the Djinni and controlling elementals | Lightning |

> Theoretically more paths exist, but nobody has discovered them.

You must find a teacher for a path to follow it, traveling to elemental planes and interacting with their high ranking denizens is usually your best bet for doing so. It doesn't hurt to find more than 1 teacher, should you wish to switch paths later.

*Beginning your path to power you open your mind and soul to the influence of the province.* 
- You have vulnerability to the damage type associated with your path. 
- When you hit a creature with an attack, or when a creature fails a save against one of your spells or features you can choose to deal 2d6 damage, of that type, to the creature.

## Close the Path
Also at 21st level, as a reaction you can use when taking your chosen damage type, you can gain immunity to damage of that type until the end of your next turn. Including the triggering attack. **You lose the benefit of all features from this class so long as you have immunity to the damage type of your path.** 

## Forking Paths
At 22nd level, you can spend a downtime taking an extended rest at wherever a teacher for your paths resides. When you do, you can switch your current path for the one this teacher provides. 

Your progress on the path now grants you the ability to cast a powerful spell.    
If your class lets you learn and/or prepare spells, that spell is automatically know/prepared for each spellcasting class you have and doesn't count towards the limit of known/prepared spells for you.     
You can also cast this spell once per long rest, without using a spell slot and not needing material components. When casting the spell in that manner, Constitution is your spellcasting ability for that spell.  

| Path to Power    | Free Spell |

### Ability Score Improvement	
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.

## Burn the Path
At 24nd level, *your progress on the path fills you to the brim with energy*. Whenever you take damage of the damage type of your path, but don't close it, *that energy overflows* and each creature other than you within 10 feet of you also takes the damage.

## Becoming Extraplanar
At 25th level, *your body and soul and the magical energy it contains become one, through a process that only someone who completes a path to power could truly understand.* This grants the following effects:

- If you have taken damage in the last minute, energy pours out from you, at the start of your turn creatures within 10ft of you take 3d6 damage of the damage type of your path. When this happens, you can choose for it to damage yourself as well.
- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non-magical attacks.
- Your type becomes Elemental.
- Your home plane is considered to be the Elemental Chaos.
- If you die while not on your home plane, your soul will be transported to the Elemental Chaos. Unless your soul was trapped somehow, this prevents most effects that can destroy souls or prevent resurrection. If you soul is not ressurected or destroyed during 1 year in the Elemental Chaos, you gather enough energy to re-form your body.

____

## Transcendant
*You have mastered your place in the universe. Expanded your being to commune with the essence of reality, which revealed to you how you could attain your ultimate self. Through calm, meditation and rejecting the material and transient, you have attained the peak of what is spiritual and eternal.*

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** none
- **Skills:** none

### Ascetic's Blessing
At 21st level, *you understand enough about yourself and about the universe that you can grant a blessing*. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that you grant to yourself. 

During a long rest, you and one other creature can meditate on this blessing. If you do, you lose the effects of the blessing and bestow them upon the other creature instead. This ability ends after you take a long rest or if you use an action to end it early.

### Transcend Materialism
At 22nd level, when you attune to a magic item that isn't Legendary or an Artifact, doesn't have charges and isn't already spiritual essence, you can choose to transform that item into it's spiritual essence. Turning an item into essence renders the original item non-magical.

As an action you can summon a weightless semi-transparent copy that has the properties of the original item. These copies can be dismissed after they are summoned (no action required). If you create a 2nd copy of an item the previous one is automatically dismissed.

You can use Spiritual Essences in the following ways:
- When you summon an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can attune to it and equip it as part of the action used to summon it.
- When you dismiss an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can unattune from it as part of dismissing it.
- Attunment to an item of Spiritial Essense does not end when the attuned creature dies.
- Even when you lose attunement to such a copy (such as when another creature attunes to it) you are still able to dismiss the copy and create a new one.
- If the original item was cursed to make you unwilling to part with it, you are also unwilling to dismiss its copy.

### Enlightened Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Spiritual Ascension
At 24th level, whenever you make a Death Saving Throw, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

While you are at 0 hp or dead, you magically control an ethereal projection that appears above your body and cannot move or be moved. The projection is an object that is immune to all damage and conditions, possesses your memories and abilities, looks identical to you, can perceive its surroundings, and speak.  This allows you to attempt certain Ability checks while dead or dying, but you cannot interact with its surroundings in any physical way, other than by using Items of Spiritual Essence. The projection can summon and use your Items of Spiritual Essence (including making attacks with any summoned weapons) it can also make unarmed attacks that deal Force instead of Bludgeoning damage.

### Spiritual Displacement
At 25th level, as an action you can make an special unarmed strike that deals no damage against a creature. If this attack hits, the target must make a Charisma Saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the highest of your Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma modifier). On a failed save the target is pushed 50ft away from you and thrown into the border Ethereal, but it leaves behind an incapacitated and prone copy of its body. 
Attacks and spells that hit the body also hit the creature in the Ethereal plane but items cannot be taken off the body.

While within the border Ethereal the target can see into the plane it was thrown out of. The only actions it can take are the Dash Action or reenter its body as an action if it is adjacent it. When it reenters the body, all of these effects end.

- **Saving Throws:** none
- **Skills:** Choose 1 from Deception, Stealth, Sleight of Hand or Performance.

### Legendary Prankster
At 21st level, *if you simply don't take your enemies seriously, then they aren't a serious threat. You are uniquely suited to make light of even the most dire life or death situations.* You have a list of bonus spells that are added to the spell lists for any spell casting class you might have. 

Up to 5 times per day, you can use an action to make a Charisma(performance) or Dexterity(sleight of hand) check and cast 1 of these spells as part of the trick, using the result of your check as the spell DC. When casting as part of a prank, you ignore the spell's normal cast time, the spell does not require concentration, and requires no components except material.

| Spell Level | Bonus Spells | 
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| 1st | Grease, Tasha's Hideous Laughter | 
| 2nd | Nathair's Mischief, Pyrotechnics |

| 5th | Dream, Seeming |

### Never Punished
At 22nd level, *it doesn't seem like you'll learn your lesson any time soon. You avoid death through what appears to be pure luck.* While you are conscious, you have the following benefits.

- You have resistance to damage inflicted due to your own movement or actions such as entering a Wall of Fire, moving through Spike Growth, drinking poison or casting Fireball at your own feet. This will not reduce damage from standing in effects that deal damage for starting or ending your turn in them.
- You have resistance to damage that doesn't originate from a creature, such as falling damage, mechanical traps, or swimming in a pool of acid.
- When you fail a saving throw by 5 or more after accounting for all bonuses, you instead fail the save by exactly 4. 

### Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Stolen blessing
At 24nd level, you steal a [blessing](blessings.md) and grant it to yourself. How? Well that is a very funny story actually...

Choose a specific deity or archdemon whose divine realm, or layer of the Abyss, you can never, ever return to. If you would somehow end up there, you and anyone traveling alongside you using the same portal or spell is instead returned to whatever plane you left from. Upon returning to the plane, you are all subjected to the Teleport spell, targeting a False destination.
				
### The Last Laugh
At 25th level, as an action you make a Charisma(performance) or Dexterity(sleight of hand) check and reduce yourself to 0 HP. Creatures of your choice within 15ft must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the result of your check. On a failed save, each takes lighting, fire or thunder damage (your choice) equal to your maximum HP minus however much HP you had before you used this ability. Creatures that succeed on the save take half as much damage.

### Ear Against The Wall
Also at 21st level, the voices of unknowable beings constantly whisper to you.  Sometimes they are even helpful!  You gain proficiency in one skill.  You can accept one random form of long-term madness to gain proficiency in another skill. The madness and skill proficiency last either 1 hour or until you take a short or long rest, whichever is shorter.  The madness received from this or similar features cannot be removed prematurely by magic like restoration.

### Blessing From Beyond The Stars
At 22nd level, you gain one [blessing](./blessings.md).

You realize that your mortal shell is capable of far more than it should be.  At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.

### Final Understanding

In addition, while suffering from madness, you can ignore one enemies' resistance to psychic damage and immunities to the charmed and frightened conditions.  You can ignore the resistances and immunities of 4 creatures this way per long rest.

## Legendary Commander
*You understand that those hoarding great power only for themselves will ultimately achieve nothing. Insurmountable power can come only from cooperation, coordination and unity! Through deep interpersonal connections, and a supernatural training regimen, you have drilled over a thousand volunteers to be every bit as powerful as you are. Your legion will be your legacy, as a unit capable of far more than any single adventurer could ever be.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that possesses a fortress stronghold in which they can train their legion.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** None
- **Skills:** Persuasion and Intimidation. (If you are already proficient in both, you instead gain a skill of your choice)

### Banner of the Legion
At 21st level, you imbue one banner bearing the symbol of your legion with the courage and confidence of the legion. Turning into an artifact magic item. 

Like any Artifact, your banner is unaffected by Anti-magic field and is immune to damage. *Part of the cloth, that contains the symbol is also self-cleaning.* However, when there is no living humanoid that was trained at your stronghold within 100ft of the banner, it loses this immunity. 

While the banner in immune to damage, a creature holding the banner in one hand can use it as a shield. The bonus to AC for this shield equals half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) 

### Stand United
*The word "legion" means "thousands", while it might not be entirely literal, you do have a lot of humanoids training at your stronghold.* You are free to bring a couple with you while adventuring (no more than 3) but most of your legion should always be busy making sure the number of them doesn't decrease.

- Your legionaries will remain within 100ft of your banner, but will otherwise follow your commands (with minimal complaining)
- Your legionaries have maximum hitpoints equal to `your maximum hitpoints, divided by the number of legionaries you brought`.
- When you take a short rest, you can spend some of your hit dice, instead of regaining hitpoints yourself each of your legionaries recovers that many hitpoints. 
- Your legionaries use your ability scores and proficiency bonus when making attacks or saves and are proficient in the same saves that you are proficient in.    
- Your legionaries do not make skill checks, but can instead use a reaction to try to assist any skill check you make. 
- Your legionaries are proficient with the same equipment you are proficient in. (Though you'll need to supply them with armor and weapons yourself)
- If you have the Martial Arts or Unarmored Defense features, your legionaries also have these. Your legionaries don't inherit any other class features or feats from you.
- Your legionaries can be of a different race than you and have their own racial traits. However, their ability scores are unchanged by their race (and racial traits that grant a feat don't work for them). 
- In combat they your legionaries their turn immediately after yours.    
- Each legionary can make only 1 attack per turn (If they cast a spell that makes multiple attacks, such as Scorching Ray, any attacks after the first are wasted). 
- If you have spell slots your legionaries have half as many spell slots, starting with all your 1st level spell slots and counting upwards. For the purpose of cantrip scaling, the legionaries are 1st level.
- Your legionaries know and prepare the same spells as you do, but can only cast spells they have spell slots for. (No ritual casting or scroll casting)

### Perfect Command
At 22nd level, *the banner of the legion exudes such unity, that even the untrained begin moving in perfect formation.*   
While holding your banner you can use the Activate Magic item action to give Perfect Commands to allied creatures that can hear you or see you.
The Perfect Commands are as follows:

* ***Shake it off!***    
Pick one condition or ongoing magical effect afflicting one of your allies. If the effect can be ended by an ability check, that ally gets to make that check immediately without spending an action. If the effect was causes by failing a saving throw, that ally can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Saving throws and ability checks prompted by this ability receive a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.  
* ***Charge!***    
Pick a number of allies up to your proficiency bonus. They can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking attacks of opportunity, then make an melee attack.
* ***Bombard!***   
Pick one or two allies. They can use their reaction to take the attack action with a ranged weapon or cast an evocation spell of 3rd level or lower.
* ***On your feet!***   
As a reaction when an ally drops to 0hp, or dies, they can spend up to 2 of their hit dice and get back up with a number of hitpoints equal to the result of these dice + their Constitution modifier for each die spent. They can stand up from being prone as part of the same reaction.
This feature can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

You can give Perfect Commands a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Whenever you complete a long rest you regain those uses.

### Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### We are Legion
Also at 24th level, *your soul and the soul of every member of your legion is bound to the banner.* So long as the banner is not destroyed, souls bound to it cannot be trapped or destroyed in a way that would prevent resurrection.

If you are dead any willing humanoid trained at your stronghold can use the banner using the Activate Magic Item action to *"become the Legendary Commander"*. This functions similar to the Reincarnate spell, but instead of creating a new body, the humanoid activating the item gives up their body for you to inhabit.

<!-- 
### Blessed Legion
At 24th level, you gain one [blessing](./blessings.md).

If this blessing can be activated using any type of action, the legionaries from Stand United can also activate this blessing. If the chosen blessing can be activated a limited number of times per rest, the legion's uses of it deduct from your own.
-->

### Inspiring Loyalty
At 25th level, *your presence and leadership inspires those around you to greatness, including off the battlefield.* Every time you take a downtime at the settlement you built your stronghold in, your followers will work alongside you, performing the same downtime within the settlement using the same ability modifiers you might use. If this costs gold, the cost is reduced by 2k from taxes contributed to the project.
