# Ashford Prestige Leveling
Here in the Ashford server, characters aren't finished when they hit level 20. If you played a character that much to bring them to that level, you probably really enjoy that character and want to continue to play them. But that means you'd be getting XP that you couldn't do anything with.

We want you to continue to feel rewarded and to look forward to play the character we've all grown familiar with as much as you want. In order to keep XP feeling like a worthwhile reward, while at the same time helping DMs not over-use the Blessings and Boons as high-level rewards. Ashford characters of level 20 can pursue a Prestige Class.

These prestige classes are homebrew classes with 5 levels. Similar to how multi-classing works, you choose one and gain levels in it. What is not similar is that these prestige classes have prerequisites. There prerequisites are there to prevent multi-classing into multiple prestige classes while also demanding that the character actually do something prestigious to earn their class.  If you desire a specific prestige class but do not reach its prerequisites, you are not required to level up to 21 until you do.

Legendary Hero is the *"legendary version of your class"* variant. It is broadly the best mechanical option for every class, without changing the flavor of your character. If you just want to be better at what your level 20 character is good at, then choose Legendary Hero. 

Other prestige options seek power that comes from outside sources, such as becoming a werewolf or embracing demonic corruption. These represent either a new focus of power for your character or a specialization into one aspect of them. They will present new and different powers to use that give you more options outside of your core class features.

### Boons and Blessings
When a prestige class allows you to take a boon or blessing, you can pick from the list on this wiki.

## Legendary Hero
*Many adventurers seek to become renowned in bardic tales. An over enthusiastic few will hire hype men as soon as they start their first adventure. But a true legend is forged by deeds that are considered impossible. A hero of legend isn't merely heroic, they are capable beyond of feats beyond belief. A true legend is a warrior, mage or trickster so skilled they can impress the gods, and is feared by man and demon alike. These figures of legend are the absolute pinacle of what is achievable by a mortal of their specialization.*

When they do so, a creature using your stat block is created in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the repository. You can choose to take control of this creature, relinquishing control of your current character if applicable.

## Dread Lich
*Those that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. Others find the lore elsewhere, hidden within Vecna's cursed memoirs.*

*Those that can bestow immortality always demand a heavy toll for this secret knowledge. Often including the memories of how lichdom is achieved.*

| Level    | XP Requirement   | PB | Features |
|:--------:|----------:|---:|:---------|
| Prestige | 450,000   | +7 | Phylactery |
| 22       | 600,000   | +7 | Undead Resilience |

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character which has the Spellcasting feature.

In order to become a lich you must bargain for the secret rituals with a being of great evil, then sacrifice and consume the soul of another sentient creature. While there is no Alignment prerequisite for starting the path to Lichdom, successfully completing the steps will always alter your alignment to Evil (even if you started on this path with the intention to use the power for the good of others.)

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, History, Medicine, or Religion. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Phylactery		
At 21st level, you perform a ritual to kill your living body and trap your soul within a phylactery. You are now an Undead.   
A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.

If you are killed, your body reforms within your phylactery 2d10 days after your death unless your phylactery is destroyed. During the next session your character participates in, you have disadvantage on any downtime checks to represent the time spent reforming your body.

Because your phylactery is your soul's primary container, your body is expendable. At any time, you can use an action to cause  your body to self-destruct in an earth-shaking burst of pure Weave energy. At the end of your next turn, you are reduced to 0 hit points and your body is destroyed. This effect cannot be prevented through the Death Ward spell or similar effects. Additionally, all creatures within 30 feet of you when you take this action in this way must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 20d6 force damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage and is not stunned. When you die in this way, your soul lingers in the area until the end of the session, upon which it returns to your phylactery. It cannot be removed from this state in any way, excepting by entering a reformed body after using your phylactery. While in this state, you you suffer the following effects:

- You are unable to cast spells of 6th level or higher.
- You are vulnerable to all damage.
- You are invisible.
- You can move through solid objects. If you end your turn within a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage.
- Your only form of movement is a fly speed of 30 feet.

### Undead Resilience					
At 22nd level, your undead form is refined, removing the weaknesses mortals have. You do not need to breathe and you do not require food, drink, or sleep. You become resistant to necrotic and lightning damage, and immune to poison damage and the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.

Additionally, if you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw, the DC of which is equal to 5 + the amount of damage taken. If you succeed on this saving throw, you drop to 1 hit point instead of 0. Additionally, you cannot die due to taking massive damage.

### Unholy Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Unholy Boon					
At 24nd level, choose either Orcus or Vecna as your patron. Choose a [boon](boons.md) that your patron grants you. 

A Lich has access to the [Boon of High Magic](boons.md#boon-of-high-magic--special).

You also gain advantage on saving throws against any effects that turn undead as well as on Charisma ability checks you make while interacting with undead creatures.
				
### Paralyzing Arcana
At 25th level, the energy of the dead within you begins to strongly affect your magic. When you cast a spell, all creatures which either fail a saving throw against the spell or are hit by an attack roll from the spell must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature is paralyzed until the end of its next turn and takes 4d6 necrotic damage. You can use this ability once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies

### Angelic Weapons					
At 21st level, your attacks become shrouded in a sheath of divine light, as the power of your deity radiates out from your hands. When you deal damage by hitting with an attack roll, the target takes an additional 2d6 radiant damage.

If you lack the Spellcasting and Pact Magic class features, the amount of radiant damage increases to 4d6 and is dealt to all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the original target. In addition, if you meet this condition and hit a creature with an attack, you can pick one creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class features, whenever you target a friendly creature with a spell, that creature regains 2d6 hit points.

### Endless Worship				
Also at 21st level, your devotion to your patron has garnered special attention, even amongst their most ardent followers. As such, they grant you an additional measure of divine power. You always have the benefits of a 9th level Death Ward spell cast upon you each day at dawn. If the Death Ward is consumed or dispelled, you regain it after one minute. While benefitting from a Death Ward spell, you do not age.

Additionallly, you can entreat your deity to bless your party once per day. You can cast a special version of Bless at 9th level; this version has a duration of 1 hour, does not require your concentration, cannot be dispelled, and persists in anti-magic zones.

### Healing Touch
You learn the Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Revivify, and Mass Healing Word spells. Wisdom is your spellcasting abillity for these spells. You gain the ability to cast each of these spells once without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.

When you cast one of these spells using this feature, you may end one condition affecting that creature and the amount of healing increases by your level, or twice your level if the target is dead.

### Divine Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.

### Angelic Form
At 25th level, you also become resistant to fire and radiant damage. 

Additionally, you grow a pair of angelic wings, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed or 60 ft., whichever is higher. You can use a bonus action to hide or manifest these wings. Any armor or clothing you wear must be designed to accomodate the wings or be torn apart when the wings are summoned. If you already have wings, this extra pair will appear behind your original wings, and your flying speed is increased by 30 feet.

When you summon these wings, all creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have one), becoming charmed or frightened by you on a failed saving throw. A creature affected in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
___

## Corrupted Champion
*Mortals can become tainted by the lower planes when they bargain with devils for power or when they are exposed to the effects of demonic corruption. High level adventurers have experience with the temptation and corruption inherent to fiends. Yet some adventurers believe the potential power to be gained is worth the risk. They believe they'll be able to resist the influence of the lower planes, and gain great power.*

This boon likely changes your body in a permanent way, granting you fiend-like features such as permanently clammy skin, black voids for eyes, or demonic horns.

### Aura of Corruption
At 25th level, you gain the ability to force creatures to their knees in your presence. If a creature begins its turn within 15 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have one). On a failed saving throw, it falls prone, kneeling. Additionally, whether the creature succeeds or fails, it takes 4d8 psychic or necrotic damage (your choice).

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that can cast spells from the Illusion school at 4th level or higher.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose 1 from Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Pick one from Deception or Performance. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Illusion of a Boon					
At 21st level, creatures with truesight cannot see through your illusions. 

Additionally, you can use illusions to drag your enemies into an unreal world of fantasy. You learn the Silent Image spell and become able to cast the spell at will, using your spellcasting ability score to do so. When you cast the Silent Image spell, all creatures within the area affected by the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, a target must take the Attack action against the nearest creature hostile to you which is not itself on each of its turns for the next minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat this saving throw, ending this effect on a successful saving throw. If a creature succeeds a saving throw against this feature, it becomes immune to the feature for the next 24 hours. 

### Life's Illusion
At 22nd level, you have set up many contingencies in the case of your fall in battle. Whenever you fall to 0 hit points, you can activate one of these contingencies, teleporting yourself to an unoccupied location within 50 feet of yourself, and causing an illusion of you to take your place. After teleporting, you become invisible and are hidden from creatures hostile to you until you take an action or one minute passes, whichever comes first.

A creature which interacts with the illusion of you or takes an action to make an Investigation check to determine an illusion against your spell save DC is immediately aware that it is an illusion. 

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you roll initiative.

### Fake Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Illusory Boon
At 24th level, you create an illusion of a blessing which fools the world into granting you the benefits of such. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md). 

### Never Really There
At 25th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. If you have the Evasion feature, you use a reaction when you make a Dexterity saving throw to grant that feature to all creatures of your choice within 30 feet.

The mundane parts of your body you have yet to replace remain susceptible to damage.

Using the Activate Magic Item action your Artifact body allows you to reproduce the effects of several spells. You cast three 1st or 2nd level spells at once that have a range of touch or self and a duration of at least one minute. This does not require any spell slots and does not require concentration.

Finally, over the course of crafting innumerable magic items, your experience has granted you proficiency in all Artisan's Tools.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Strength, Wisdom, or Intelligence. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Undying Guardian
At 21st level, your vitality has been integrated into your druid grove, up to one square mile of land you personally guard. You are now a Plant.

If you are killed, your body reforms within your druid grove 2d10 days after your death unless your druid grove is destroyed. During the next session your character participates in, you have disadvantage on any downtime checks to represent the time spent reforming your body. Because you have already given your soul up to pursue this form of undeath, you are immune to any effect that would prevent your resurrection.

Due to your form, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources.
- If your body is in contact with the ground, you regenerate 1 hit point at the start of a turn.

### Wrath of Nature
Starting at 22nd level, you add your Wisdom modifier to any attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws you make using your Strength or Consitution modifier. 

Additionally, you can utilize the vines, branches, and roots on your body to make attacks. You gain access to the following attack. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

##### Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 6d8 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. On a hit, the target is grappled by you (escape DC equal to 8 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus). While grappled in this way, the target is restrained. 

### Mossy Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1 by weaving additional powerful effects into your body. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Nature's Boon
At 24nd level, the nature spirits you guard grant you a [boon](boons.md).

### Spore Cloud
Starting at 25th level, your body is host to fungi which produce necrotic spores. As a bonus action, you can cause these fungi to radiate spores in a 15-foot radius around you. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn within the area, it must make a Constitution saving throw, the DC of which is equal to your spell save DC, or if you do not have a spell save DC, 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage and is affected by the poisoned condition for one minute. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage and is not poisoned. If a creature which was poisoned in this way ends its turn while not inside this area, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the condition on a successful saving throw. 

As an action, you can cause these fungi to produce immunizing spores. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you when you take this action automatically succeed any saving throws against this feature and take no damage on a successful saving throw. In addition, immunized creatures have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition until they complete a long rest.

## Paths of Power
*Do not be fooled that the schools of magic, that wizards so love to categorize spells into, are the be-all-end-all of magic. Genies have been perfecting their own magic for millennia before some Netherese bookworm even learned to read. Paths of power require endurance and dedication, as well as a gifted teacher to master. But can teach magic without any required reading.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:
Any level 20 Ashford character that manages to find a teacher for a path of their choice.

> Such sages are powerful and ancient extraplanar creatures, the kind that could grant a warlock pact. But you aren't looking for a pact, you want to follow the exact path they took to become powerful.
> 
> Usually this requires you to supplicate yourself to such a creature to gain access to their planar domain.   
> However in the continent of Zakhara there exists secret schools where elementalists emulate the lives of former elemental princes. Usually such schools will require you swear loyalty to their cause, in order to receive their teachings. 

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** none
- **Skills:** none

## Step onto the Path
At 21st level, you move away from the traditional theories of magic and develop a different understanding.

> The elemental planes and Elemental Chaos (including the many para-elemental planes where elements mix together) can be subdivided into provinces.    
> Any path through such a *"province"* could seek its center, mastering the pure form of an element. Alternatively, a path could also visit the borders, mastering how to combine an element with others.

| Province | Path to Power    | Damage Type  |
|:--------:|:-----------------|:------------:|
| Bone | Eternal youth and strength | Necrotic | 
| Flame| [Brotherhood of the True Flame](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_True_Flame) | Fire  | 
| Flame | Fire and light to see clearly and provide insight | Radiant |
| Flame | Protection of the Efreeti and controlling elementals | Fire | 
| Sand | Sandman's path, inducing sleep and stillness | Cold |
| Sand | Glassblower's path, using heat for transmutation | Fire |
| Sand | Protection of the Dao and controlling elementals | Acid |
| Sea | Using fog, water and ice to distract and attack | Cold  |
| Sea | Protection of the Marid and controlling elementals | Cold |
| Wind | Manipulating winds, air, sound and visibility | Thunder  |
| Wind | Protection of the Djinni and controlling elementals | Lightning |

> Theoretically more paths exist, but nobody has discovered them.

You must find a teacher for a path to follow it, traveling to elemental planes and interacting with their high ranking denizens is usually your best bet for doing so. It doesn't hurt to find more than 1 teacher, should you wish to switch paths later.

*Beginning your path to power you open your mind and soul to the influence of the province.* 
- You have vulnerability to the damage type associated with your path. 
- When you hit a creature with an attack, or when a creature fails a save against one of your spells or features you can choose to deal 2d6 damage, of that type, to the creature.

## Close the Path
Also at 21st level, as a reaction you can use when taking your chosen damage type, you can gain immunity to damage of that type until the end of your next turn. Including the triggering attack. **You lose the benefit of all features from this class so long as you have immunity to the damage type of your path.** 

## Forking Paths
At 22nd level, you can spend a downtime taking an extended rest at wherever a teacher for your paths resides. When you do, you can switch your current path for the one this teacher provides. 

Your progress on the path now grants you the ability to cast a powerful spell.    
If your class lets you learn and/or prepare spells, that spell is automatically know/prepared for each spellcasting class you have and doesn't count towards the limit of known/prepared spells for you.     
You can also cast this spell once per long rest, without using a spell slot and not needing material components. When casting the spell in that manner, Constitution is your spellcasting ability for that spell.  

| Path to Power    | Free Spell |

### Ability Score Improvement	
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.

## Burn the Path
At 24nd level, *your progress on the path fills you to the brim with energy*. Whenever you take damage of the damage type of your path, but don't close it, *that energy overflows* and each creature other than you within 10 feet of you also takes the damage.

## Becoming Extraplanar
At 25th level, *your body and soul and the magical energy it contains become one, through a process that only someone who completes a path to power could truly understand.* This grants the following effects:

- If you have taken damage in the last minute, energy pours out from you, at the start of your turn creatures within 10ft of you take 3d6 damage of the damage type of your path. When this happens, you can choose for it to damage yourself as well.
- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non-magical attacks.
- Your type becomes Elemental.
- Your home plane is considered to be the Elemental Chaos.
- If you die while not on your home plane, your soul will be transported to the Elemental Chaos. Unless your soul was trapped somehow, this prevents most effects that can destroy souls or prevent resurrection. If you soul is not ressurected or destroyed during 1 year in the Elemental Chaos, you gather enough energy to re-form your body.

## Transcendant
*You have mastered your place in the universe. Expanded your being to commune with the essence of reality, which revealed to you how you could attain your ultimate self. Through calm, meditation and rejecting the material and transient, you have attained the peak of what is spiritual and eternal.*

At 21st level, *you understand enough about yourself and about the universe that you can grant a blessing*. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that you grant to yourself. 

During a long rest, you and one other creature can meditate on this blessing. If you do, you lose the effects of the blessing and bestow them upon the other creature instead. This ability ends after you take a long rest or if you use an action to end it early.

### Transcend Materialism
At 22nd level, when you attune to a magic item that isn't Legendary or an Artifact, doesn't have charges and isn't already spiritual essence, you can choose to transform that item into it's spiritual essence. Turning an item into essence renders the original item non-magical.

As an action you can summon a weightless semi-transparent copy that has the properties of the original item. These copies can be dismissed after they are summoned (no action required). If you create a 2nd copy of an item the previous one is automatically dismissed.

You can use Spiritual Essences in the following ways:
- When you summon an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can attune to it and equip it as part of the action used to summon it.
- When you dismiss an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can unattune from it as part of dismissing it.
- Attunment to an item of Spiritial Essense does not end when the attuned creature dies.
- Even when you lose attunement to such a copy (such as when another creature attunes to it) you are still able to dismiss the copy and create a new one.
- If the original item was cursed to make you unwilling to part with it, you are also unwilling to dismiss its copy.

### Enlightened Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.

At 24th level, whenever you make a Death Saving Throw, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

While you are at 0 hp or dead, you magically control an ethereal projection that appears above your body and cannot move or be moved. The projection is an object that is immune to all damage and conditions, possesses your memories and abilities, looks identical to you, can perceive its surroundings, and speak.  This allows you to attempt certain Ability checks while dead or dying, but you cannot interact with its surroundings in any physical way, other than by using Items of Spiritual Essence. The projection can summon and use your Items of Spiritual Essence (including making attacks with any summoned weapons) it can also make unarmed attacks that deal Force instead of Bludgeoning damage.

### Spiritual Displacement
At 25th level, as an action you can make an special unarmed strike that deals no damage against a creature. If this attack hits, the target must make a Charisma Saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the highest of your Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma modifier). On a failed save the target is pushed 50ft away from you and thrown into the border Ethereal, but it leaves behind an incapacitated and prone copy of its body. 
Attacks and spells that hit the body also hit the creature in the Ethereal plane but items cannot be taken off the body.

While within the border Ethereal the target can see into the plane it was thrown out of. The only actions it can take are the Dash Action or reenter its body as an action if it is adjacent it. When it reenters the body, all of these effects end.

Up to 5 times per day, you can use an action to make a Charisma(performance) or Dexterity(sleight of hand) check and cast 1 of these spells as part of the trick, using the result of your check as the spell DC. When casting as part of a prank, you ignore the spell's normal cast time, the spell does not require concentration, and requires no components except material.

| 2nd | Nathair's Mischief, Pyrotechnics |

### Never Punished
At 22nd level, *it doesn't seem like you'll learn your lesson any time soon. You avoid death through what appears to be pure luck.* While you are conscious, you have the following benefits.

- You have resistance to damage inflicted due to your own movement or actions such as entering a Wall of Fire, moving through Spike Growth, drinking poison or casting Fireball at your own feet. This will not reduce damage from standing in effects that deal damage for starting or ending your turn in them.
- You have resistance to damage that doesn't originate from a creature, such as falling damage, mechanical traps, or swimming in a pool of acid.

Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Stolen blessing
At 24nd level, you steal a [blessing](blessings.md) and grant it to yourself. How? Well that is a very funny story actually...

Choose a specific deity or archdemon whose divine realm, or layer of the Abyss, you can never, ever return to. If you would somehow end up there, you and anyone traveling alongside you using the same portal or spell is instead returned to whatever plane you left from. Upon returning to the plane, you are all subjected to the Teleport spell, targeting a False destination.
				
### The Last Laugh
At 25th level, as an action you make a Charisma(performance) or Dexterity(sleight of hand) check and reduce yourself to 0 HP. Creatures of your choice within 15ft must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the result of your check. On a failed save, each takes lighting, fire or thunder damage (your choice) equal to your maximum HP minus however much HP you had before you used this ability. Creatures that succeed on the save take half as much damage.

You gain 1 form of indefinite madness: *"It is not you that is mad, it is everyone else."*

### Word Of The Prophet
At 25th level, Your  mind serves as a gateway to the Far Realms. You can cast Gate once per day, but it can only open somewhere within the Far Realms.  

In addition, while suffering from madness, you can ignore one enemies' resistance to psychic damage and immunities to the charmed and frightened conditions.  You can ignore the resistances and immunities of 4 creatures this way per long rest.

## Legendary Commander
*You understand that those hoarding great power only for themselves will ultimately achieve nothing. Insurmountable power can come only from cooperation, coordination and unity! Through deep interpersonal connections, and a supernatural training regimen, you have drilled over a thousand volunteers to be every bit as powerful as you are. Your legion will be your legacy, as a unit capable of far more than any single adventurer could ever be.*

</div>

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that possesses a fortress stronghold in which they can train their legion.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** None
- **Skills:** Persuasion and Intimidation. (If you are already proficient in both, you instead gain a skill of your choice)

### Banner of the Legion
At 21st level, you imbue one banner bearing the symbol of your legion with the courage and confidence of the legion. Turning into an artifact magic item. 

Like any Artifact, your banner is unaffected by Anti-magic field and is immune to damage. *Part of the cloth, that contains the symbol is also self-cleaning.* However, when there is no living humanoid that was trained at your stronghold within 100ft of the banner, it loses this immunity. 

While the banner in immune to damage, a creature holding the banner in one hand can use it as a shield. The bonus to AC for this shield equals half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) 

### Stand United
*The word "legion" means "thousands", while it might not be entirely literal, you do have a lot of humanoids training at your stronghold.* You are free to bring a couple with you while adventuring (no more than 3) but most of your legion should always be busy making sure the number of them doesn't decrease.

- Your legionaries will not move further than 100ft from your banner. If they start their turn more than 100 feet away, they will only take the dash action to move closer to it.
- In combat, they will follow your commands (no action required).
- Your legionaries have maximum hitpoints equal to `your maximum hitpoints, divided by the number of legionaries you brought`.
- When you spend hit dice during a short rest, you can choose for one of your legionaires to gain hit points instead of yourself. 
- Your legionaries use your ability scores and proficiency bonus when making attacks rolls, determining DCs, and making saving throws.  They are proficient in the same skills and saving throws as you.    
- Your legionaries do not make skill checks, but can still use the Help action to give advantage on a skill check.
- Your legionaries are proficient with the same equipment you are proficient in. (Though you'll need to supply them with armor and weapons yourself)
- If you have the Martial Arts, Unarmored Defense and/or Fighting Style features, your legionaries also have these. Your legionaries don't inherit any other class features or feats from you.
- Your legionaries can be of a different race than you and have their own racial traits. However, their ability scores are unchanged by their race (and racial traits that grant a feat don't work for them). 
- In combat your legionaries take their turn immediately after yours.    
- Each legionary can make only 1 attack per turn (If they cast a spell that makes multiple attacks, such as Scorching Ray, any attacks after the first are wasted). 
- Your legionaries have half as many spell slots as you do (rounded down), divided between themselves, up to a maximum of 8 each. Calulate this number by starting with your 1st level spell slots, then count upwards, until you either reach 8 or half the total number of spell slots you have. If this would grant your pact magic spell slots to your legionaries, those pact magic slots are at most 3rd level for them and restore on a long rest.    
-- `i.e., of the three legionairies following a 20th level wizard, two would have  4 1st level slots and one would have 3 1st level slots.  The singular legionairy following a paladin would have 4 1st level slots and 3 2nd level slots.`
For the purpose of cantrip scaling, the legionaries are 1st level.
- Your legionaries know and prepare the same spells as you do, but can only cast spells they have spell slots for. They cannot cast ritual spells or spells from scrolls.

### Perfect Command
At 22nd level, *the banner of the legion exudes such unity, that even the untrained begin moving in perfect formation.*   
While holding your banner you can use the Activate Magic item action to give Perfect Commands to allied creatures that can hear you or see you.
The Perfect Commands are as follows:

* ***Shake it off!***    
Pick one condition or ongoing magical effect afflicting one of your allies. If the effect can be ended by an ability check, that ally gets to make that check immediately without spending an action. If the effect was causes by failing a saving throw, that ally can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Saving throws and ability checks prompted by this ability receive a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.  
* ***Charge!***    
Pick a number of allies up to your proficiency bonus. They can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking attacks of opportunity, then make an melee attack.
* ***Bombard!***   
Pick one or two allies. They can use their reaction to take the attack action with a ranged weapon or cast an evocation spell of 3rd level or lower.
* ***On your feet!***   
When an ally drops to 0hp or dies, you can use a reaction to shout words whose inspiration alone inspire them to keep fighting.  They can use a reaction to spend up to 2 of their hit dice and regain hitpoints equal to the result of the dice + their Constitution modifier for each die spent. They can stand up from being prone as part of the same reaction.
This feature can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

You can give Perfect Commands a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Whenever you complete a long rest, you regain these uses.

### Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### We are Legion
Also at 24th level, *your soul and the soul of every member of your legion is bound to the banner.* So long as the banner is not destroyed, souls bound to it cannot be trapped or destroyed in a way that would prevent resurrection.

If you are dead, any willing humanoid trained at your stronghold can use the banner using the Activate Magic Item action to *"become the Legendary Commander"*. This process takes three rounds, during which the creature cannot move or take actions and must concentrate on like a spell. Their ideals, bonds, flaws, character traits, proficiencies, ability scores, and features become yours.  This functions similar to the Reincarnate spell, but instead of creating a new body, the humanoid activating the item gives up their body for you to inhabit.

<!-- 
### Blessed Legion
At 24th level, you gain one [blessing](./blessings.md).

If this blessing can be activated using any type of action, the legionaries from Stand United can also activate this blessing. If the chosen blessing can be activated a limited number of times per rest, the legion's uses of it deduct from your own.
-->

### Inspiring Loyalty
At 25th level, *your presence and leadership inspires those around you to greatness, including off the battlefield.* Every time you take a downtime at the settlement you built your stronghold in, your followers will work alongside you, performing the same downtime within the settlement using the same ability modifiers you might use. If this costs gold, the cost is reduced by 2k from taxes contributed to the project.

___

## Ur Dragon Disciple
*Ur Dragons were created by Io, the Ninefold Dragon, as soldiers for the conflict between gods, titans and primordials. Capable of rivaling the gods of giants, Ur dragons would split into 2 weaker dragons when slain. Every Ur dragon that existed has since been split, but if a mortal were to receive the blessings of both the surviving halves, the fusion of draconic power could be so much greater than its parts.*

</div>

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that successfully pledges themselves to an aspect of an Ur dragon. 

The 2 halves of an Ur dragon are always opposites, the most famous pair is Bahamut and Tiamat. But other surviving pairs exist, such as Faluzure and Chronepsis, Kalzareinad and Kereska. Many other halves have perished in the many years since The Days of Thunder, but even so you might still be able to obtain some of their essences and combine those.

The halves of an Ur dragon are opposites in alignment and usually hate each other. Your goal to reunite them is perhaps best kept secret for now.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose Strength, Constitution, or Charisma saves. If you make a save of that type and are not proficient, you add half your proficiency bonus.

### Draconic Influence
At 21st level, you absorb the essence of one dragon you have sought out, it grants you the proficiencies listed above.

Describe the first dragon of the pair you seek to reunite, specifically choosing the color of dragon you believe they are from the table below.

|:------|:-----|-------:|
|Amythyst   |30ft cone                  | force      |

|Emerald    |30ft cone                  | psychic    |
|Gold       |90ft cone                  | fire       |
|Green      |90ft cone                  | poison     |
|Lunar      |60ft cone                  | cold       |
|Moonstone  |60ft long, 5ft wide line   | psychic    |
|Platinum   |60ft long, 5ft wide line   | radiant    |
|Red        |90ft cone                  | fire       |
|Sapphire   |30ft cone                  | Thunder    |
|Silver     |60ft cone                  | cold       |
|Topaz      |90ft cone                  | necrotic   |
|White      |60ft cone                  | cold       |

One of your eyes changes appearance to resemble the eye of your draconic patron. Usually the color of the dragon you received essence from is also reflected in other changes to your appearance, such as your nails and if you have any, your scales or your hair might also be affected.

You also gain one of the following features: 

- If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, you gain *Ur Dragon's Breath Improvement*.
- If you do not have a breath weapon that recharges when resting, you instead gain the Ur Dragon's Breath feature.

#### Ur Dragon's Breath Improvement
If you have a breath weapon with expended charges, you regain 1 charge for 1 breath weapon of your choice when you roll initiative.

Additionally, if you have a breath weapon that has no charges remaining, you can roll a d6 at the end of each of your turns, on a 6 your breath weapon regains 1 charge.

When you use a breath weapon that requires charges, you can choose to apply 1 or both of the following effects:

- You can chose for it to deal `5d10` damage instead of its normal damage.
- You can change both the area and damage type to the area and damage type associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence feature.

#### Ur Dragon's Breath
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in the shape associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence feature.  
Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking `5d10` damage of the type associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence feature on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use your breath weapon once. If your breath is expended when you roll initiative it recharges. 
Additionally, while your breath is expended, at the end of each of your turns in combat you can roll a d6, on a 6 your breath weapon recharges.

### Draconic Element
At 22nd level, you gain resistance to damage type associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence. 

When you cause a creature to take damage of that type, you can choose for the creature to take additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you do, you cannot do so again until the start of your next turn.

For the purposes of the [Boon of Elemental Mastery](boons.md#boon-of-elemental-mastery--new), this feature counts as you having the Elemental Adept feat; even if the damage type isn't elemental. 

### Draconic Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Draconic Boon
At 24th level, the draconic essense you absorbed manifests in the form of a [boon](boons.md) of your choice.

### Union of Essences
At 25th level, combine the essence of a second dragon with the first. Describe the second dragon of the pair, the opposite of the first, specifically choosing their color from the Draconic Influence table. 

Your Ur Dragon's Breath Improvement or Ur Dragon's Breath and you Draconic Element features can now use either the first color or second color, choosing one whenever you use that feature. 

Your other eye changes to resemble that of the dragon you described, and you gain Truesight out to a distance of 30ft.

Any other changes that happened at 21st level now change further incorporating the second color in addition to the first.

## Colored Mana Ritualist
*@TODO "Weave bad, I'll make my own magic energy, with blackjack and hookers".*

<div class='classTable'>

| Level    | XP Requirement   | PB | Features |
|:--------:|----------:|---:|:---------|
| Prestige | 450,000   | +7 | Ley Line Zoning Law, Fountain of Magic |
| 22       | 600,000   | +7 | Colored Mana |
| 23       | 805,000   | +7 | Ability Score Improvement	|
| 24       | 1,100,000 | +7 | Mana Burn |
| 25       | 1,500,000 | +8 | Planeswalking |
</div>

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that learns how to use colored mana from a powerful caster in Ravnica, Zendikar, Innistrad, Kaladesh, Amonkhet, Ixalan, or Dominaria. Places that can be accessed using the Dream of the Blue Veil spell. 

In order to benefit from this training a character must also have the ability to scribe rituals into a book, be it from the Ritual Caster feat, Book of Ancient Secrets invocation, or the Wizard version of the Ritual Casting feature.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** None
- **Skills:** Arcana, Investigation or Survival

### Ley Line Zoning Law
At 21st level, you learn a new ritual you can use to siphon magic from the ley lines of your home plane. Once started this ritual passively charges up magical energy, that you can then summon to your location when you need it.

You can perform this ritual at a number of locations equal to `1 + your levels in this prestige class`. Each such location must be at least 30 miles from any other location where this ritual was performed, by ANY ritualist. 

> If you perform the ritual at an invalid location you learn how far you are from the overlapping ritual. Though even if you can find the offending ritual circle, you'll need the ritualist that performed it to be either willing or dead before you can end their claim and put down your own.

From each location you perform this ritual you must take a single token that reminds you of the location, such as a jar of sand, an unusual rock or a vial of water. *(anything that would be considered an Associated Object for the Teleport spell)* The ritual imbues these tokens with a magical connection. *(they count as a magic items, including for the Dream of the Blue Veil spell)*

### Fountain of Magic
While touching a token from the Ley Line Zoning Law feature, you can use a bonus action to gain 1 charge for Fountain of Magic, as you begin channeling power from a ley line to yourself. When you do this, a rush of color, as well as the smells or sounds of that area briefly surround you.  
You can only gain 1 charge from each token you have, and can only activate 1 token per turn.

At the end of your turns you can spend any number of charges from Fountain of Magic to instantly cast a Ritual Spell you know of a level equal to the number of charges spent. You can also upcast ritual spells by spending a number of charges greater than the level of the spell.

Keeping channels of ley line energy open for a long time is harmful to your body. Every 10 minutes (once every 100 rounds) you magically take force damage equal to `the level of the highest non-ritual spell you can cast × any unspent Fountain of Magic charges`, this damage ignores immunity to force damage. If this damage would force a saving throw to maintain concentration, you have disadvantage on that save.

If you roll Initiative while you have unspent Fountain of Magic charges, you take the damage immediately and the 10 minute countdown resets.

### Colored Mana
At 22nd level, the environments that you draw your Fountains of Magic from *color* your rituals. That means you can use Fountain of Magic to cast certain non-ritual spells, depending on how dedicated you are to a specific biome. 

| Environment | 2 Tokens | 3 Tokens | 4 Tokens | 5 Tokens |
|:------------|:--------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Island, Coast | Rime's Binding Ice | Major Image | Ice Storm | Mislead |
| Mountain, Volcano | Maximilian's Earthen Grasp | Fireball | Stone Shape | Immolation |
| Swamp, Underdark | Melf's Acid Arrow | Summon Undead | Phantasmal Killer | Cloudkill |
| Forest, Jungle | Summon Beast | Conjure Barrage | Polymorph | Insect Plague |
| Desert, Plains, Savannah | Spike Growth | Wall of Sand | Guardian of Faith | Summon Celestial |
| City, Other | Knock | Create Food and Water | Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound | Circle of Power |

While you are carrying the correct number of tokens of a specific kind you can cast these spells using Fountain of Magic charges. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is the same spellcasting ability your ritual book uses.

If you can cast spells using spell slots, the spells that you are carrying the correct tokens for are also added to your known/prepared spells without counting towards the limit of known/prepared spells.

### Ley Line Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Mana Burn
At 24th level, you can try to use your magical endurance and mastery of holding onto and slowly channeling energy during ritual magic to overwhelm what the average 'one pump chump' caster can handle. 

As a reaction to seeing a creature cast a spell, you can deal force damage to it equal to `the level of the highest spell that creature can cast × any unspent Fountain of Magic charges you have`, this damage ignores immunity to force damage. If this damage would force a saving throw to maintain concentration, that creature has disadvantage on the save.

Using this ability reset the 10 minutes you can hold onto Fountain of Magic charges without taking damage. You must finish a long rest before you can use this ability again.

### Planeswalking
At 25th level, you can cast the Dream of the Blue Veil spell as a ritual. 

Additionally, once per session, when you are reduced to 0 hitpoints or immediately before you would suffer a 3rd failed death save, you can choose to teleport to one of your ritual circles from Ley Line Zoning Law. You arrive unconcious, but stable.
