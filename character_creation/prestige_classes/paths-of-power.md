### Prestige Class Prerequisites:
Any level 20 Ashford character that can cast a cantrip.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Constitution, Wisdom, or Intelligence. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, Religion, or Investigation. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

## Step onto the Path
You have studied one cantrip, taking apart its inner workings and reassembling it to suit your purposes. At 21st level, choose one cantrip you know. If the cantrip does not involve dealing damage in any way, you gain the ability to use its magic in a way to bring harm to other creatures. When you cast that cantrip, you can make a spell attack roll against a creature within the range of that cantrip. On a hit, that creature takes 5d10 force damage.

Additionally, you then grant the chosen cantrip one of the following benefits. 

- When you damage a creature using that cantrip, you deal additional damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.
- When you damage a creature using that cantrip, you can move the target creature up to 10 feet directly towards or away from you.
- You change the casting time of that cantrip to 1 bonus action.
- Instead of scaling through dealing an additional damage dice, the chosen cantrip now scales through gaining an additional attack or saving throw. 

## Minor Success
In your pursuit of mastery over your chosen cantrip, your research has borne fruit, allowing you to gain ancilliary benefits when you cast the chosen cantrip. Starting at 22nd level, when you cast the cantrip chosen through your 21st level feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier. Additionally, the cantrip functions even in an antimagic field. Finally, you gain resistance to one damage type the cantrip deals.


### Ability Score Improvement	
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.

## Burn the Path
At 24nd level, *your progress on the path fills you to the brim with energy*. Whenever you take damage of the damage type of your path, but don't close it, *that energy overflows* and each creature other than you within 10 feet of you also takes the damage.

## Elemental Form
At 25th level, *your body and soul and the magical energy it contains become one, through a process that only someone who completes a path to power could truly understand.* This grants the following effects:

- If you have taken damage in the last minute, energy pours out from you, at the start of your turn creatures within 10ft of you take 3d6 damage of the damage type of your path. When this happens, you can choose for it to damage yourself as well.
- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non-magical attacks.
- Your type becomes Elemental.
- Your home plane is considered to be the Elemental Chaos.
- If you die while not on your home plane, your soul will be transported to the Elemental Chaos. Unless your soul was trapped somehow, this prevents most effects that can destroy souls or prevent resurrection. If you soul is not ressurected or destroyed during 1 year in the Elemental Chaos, you gather enough energy to re-form your body.
