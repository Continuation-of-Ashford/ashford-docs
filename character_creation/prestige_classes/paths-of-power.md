- When you cast the chosen cantrip, you can select one target within the range of the cantrip. You make a spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 damage, the type of which corresponds to the type denoted for each cantrip in the table above. Additionally, the target is knocked prone.
- As a bonus action on each subsequent turn within one minute, you can cause all creatures which have taken damage from the chosen cantrip to take 2d8 damage, the type of which corresponds to the type denoted for each cantrip in the table above.

Regardless of the cantrip you choose, the cantrip chosen is called your Arcane Specialty.

## Minor Success
In your pursuit of mastery over your chosen cantrip, your research has borne fruit, allowing you to gain ancilliary benefits when you cast the chosen cantrip. Starting at 22nd level, when you cast your Arcane Specialty, you increase your Armor Class by 2 until the start of your next turn. This bonus does not stack with itself. Additionally, the cantrip functions even in an antimagic field. Finally, you gain resistance to one damage type the cantrip deals.

### Ability Score Improvement	
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.

## Focused Boon
At 24nd level, choose a [boon](boons.md) that your patron grants you. 

You also bypass resistances and immunities with your Arcane Specialty.

## Final Destination
At 25th level, your research of your Arcane Specialty has reached a state of perfection, a state of both flexibility and strength, weight and agility. When you cast your Arcane Specialty, you can expend a spell slot of 5th level or lower. When you do so, you immediately cast the cantrip an additional number of times equal to half the level of the spell slot expended, rounded up.
