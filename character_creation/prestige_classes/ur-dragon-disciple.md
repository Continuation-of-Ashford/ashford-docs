## Ur Dragon Disciple
*Ur Dragons were created by Io, the Ninefold Dragon, as soldiers for the conflict between gods, titans and primordials. Capable of rivaling the gods of giants, Ur dragons would split into 2 weaker dragons when slain. Every Ur dragon that existed has since been split, but if a mortal were to receive the blessings of both the surviving halves, the fusion of draconic power could be so much greater than its parts.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that successfully pledges themselves to an aspect of an Ur dragon. 

The 2 halves of an Ur dragon are always opposites, the most famous pair is Bahamut and Tiamat. But other surviving pairs exist, such as Faluzure and Chronepsis, Kalzareinad and Kereska. Many other halves have perished in the many years since The Days of Thunder, but even so you might still be able to obtain some of their essences and combine those.

The halves of an Ur dragon are opposites in alignment and usually hate each other. Your goal to reunite them is perhaps best kept secret for now.

One of your eyes changes appearance to resemble the eye of your draconic patron. Usually the color of the dragon you received essence from is also reflected in other changes to your appearance, such as your nails and if you have any, your scales or your hair might also be affected.

You also gain one of the following features: 

- If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, you gain *Ur Dragon's Breath Improvement*.
- If you do not have a breath weapon that recharges when resting, you instead gain the Ur Dragon's Breath feature.

#### Ur Dragon's Breath Improvement
If you have a breath weapon with expended charges, you regain 1 charge for 1 breath weapon of your choice when you roll initiative.

Additionally, if you have a breath weapon that has no charges remaining, you can roll a d6 at the end of each of your turns, on a 6 your breath weapon regains 1 charge.

When you use a breath weapon that requires charges, you can choose to apply 1 or both of the following effects:

- You can chose for it to deal `5d10` damage instead of its normal damage.
- You can change both the area and damage type to the area and damage type associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence feature.

#### Ur Dragon's Breath
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in the shape associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence feature.  
Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking `5d10` damage of the type associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence feature on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use your breath weapon once. If your breath is expended when you roll initiative it recharges. 
Additionally, while your breath is expended, at the end of each of your turns in combat you can roll a d6, on a 6 your breath weapon recharges.

### Draconic Element
At 22nd level, you gain resistance to damage type associated with the color you chose for your Draconic Influence. 

When you cause a creature to take damage of that type, you can choose for the creature to take additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you do, you cannot do so again until the start of your next turn.

For the purposes of the [Boon of Elemental Mastery](boons.md#boon-of-elemental-mastery--new), this feature counts as you having the Elemental Adept feat; even if the damage type isn't elemental. 

### Draconic Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Draconic Boon
At 24th level, the draconic essense you absorbed manifests in the form of a [boon](boons.md) of your choice.

### Union of Essences
At 25th level, combine the essence of a second dragon with the first. Describe the second dragon of the pair, the opposite of the first, specifically choosing their color from the Draconic Influence table. 

Your Ur Dragon's Breath Improvement or Ur Dragon's Breath and you Draconic Element features can now use either the first color or second color, choosing one whenever you use that feature. 

Your other eye changes to resemble that of the dragon you described, and you gain Truesight out to a distance of 30ft.

Any other changes that happened at 21st level now change further incorporating the second color in addition to the first.
