### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that can cast spells from the Illusion school at 4th level or higher.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose 1 from Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Pick one from Deception, Persuasion, Performance, or Sleight of Hand. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Storyteller's Illusion					
At 21st level, creatures with truesight cannot see through your illusions. 

Additionally, you can use illusions to drag your enemies into an unreal world of fantasy. You learn the Silent Image spell and become able to cast the spell at will, using your spellcasting ability score to do so. When you cast the Silent Image spell, all creatures within the area affected by the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, a target must take the Attack action against the nearest creature hostile to you which is not itself on each of its turns for the next minute, using its movement to move closer to the target of the Attack action. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat this saving throw, ending this effect on a successful saving throw. If a creature succeeds a saving throw against this feature, it becomes immune to the feature for the next 24 hours. 

### Life's Illusion
At 22nd level, you have set up many contingencies in the case of your fall in battle. Whenever you would fall to 0 hit points or die, you can activate one of these contingencies, instead teleporting yourself to an unoccupied location within 50 feet of yourself, and causing an illusion of you to take your place. After teleporting, you regain hit points equal to your level, become invisible, and are hidden from creatures hostile to you until you take an action or one minute passes, whichever comes first.

A creature which interacts with the illusion of you or takes an action to make an Investigation check to determine an illusion against your spell save DC is immediately aware that it is an illusion. 

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you roll initiative.

### Fake Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Illusory Blessing
At 24th level, you create an illusion of a blessing which fools the world into granting you the benefits of such. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md). 

### Never Really There
At 25th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. If you have the Evasion feature, you can use a reaction when you make a Dexterity saving throw to grant that feature to all creatures of your choice within 30 feet until the end of the current turn.
