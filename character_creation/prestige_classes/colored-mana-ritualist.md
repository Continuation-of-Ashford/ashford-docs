### Ley Line Zoning Law
At 21st level, you learn a new ritual you can use to siphon magic from the ley lines of your home plane. Once started this ritual passively charges up magical energy, that you can then summon to your location when you need it.

You can perform this ritual at a number of locations equal to `1 + your levels in this prestige class`. Each such location must be at least 30 miles from any other location where you performed this ritual. As an action, you may teleport yourself and up to six willing creatures to a location where you have performed this ritual. You must take a long rest before you can teleport with this feature again.

From each location you perform this ritual you must take a single token that reminds you of the location, such as a jar of sand, an unusual rock or a vial of water. *(anything that would be considered an Associated Object for the Teleport spell)* The ritual imbues these tokens with a magical connection. *(they count as a magic items, including for the Dream of the Blue Veil spell)*

### Fountain of Magic
While touching a token from the Ley Line Zoning Law feature, you can use a bonus action to gain 1 charge for Fountain of Magic, as you begin channeling power from a ley line to yourself. When you do this, a rush of color, as well as the smells or sounds of that area briefly surround you.  
You can only gain 1 charge from each token you have, and can only activate 1 token per turn.

At the end of your turns you can spend any number of charges from Fountain of Magic to instantly cast a Ritual Spell you know of a level equal to the number of charges spent. You can also upcast ritual spells by spending a number of charges greater than the level of the spell.

Keeping channels of ley line energy open for a long time is harmful to your body. Every 10 minutes (once every 100 rounds) you magically take force damage equal to `the level of the highest non-ritual spell you can cast × any unspent Fountain of Magic charges`, this damage ignores immunity to force damage. If this damage would force a saving throw to maintain concentration, you have disadvantage on that save.

If you roll Initiative while you have unspent Fountain of Magic charges, you take the damage immediately and the 10 minute countdown resets.

### Colored Mana
At 22nd level, the environments that you draw your Fountains of Magic from *color* your rituals. That means you can use Fountain of Magic to cast certain non-ritual spells, depending on how dedicated you are to a specific biome. 

| Environment | 2 Tokens | 3 Tokens | 4 Tokens | 5 Tokens |
|:------------|:--------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Island, Coast | Rime's Binding Ice | Major Image | Ice Storm | Mislead |
| Mountain, Volcano | Maximilian's Earthen Grasp | Fireball | Stone Shape | Immolation |
| Swamp, Underdark | Melf's Acid Arrow | Summon Undead | Phantasmal Killer | Cloudkill |
| Forest, Jungle | Summon Beast | Conjure Barrage | Polymorph | Insect Plague |
| Desert, Plains, Savannah | Spike Growth | Wall of Sand | Guardian of Faith | Summon Celestial |
| City, Other | Knock | Create Food and Water | Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound | Circle of Power |

While you are carrying the correct number of tokens of a specific kind you can cast these spells using Fountain of Magic charges. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is the same spellcasting ability your ritual book uses.

If you can cast spells using spell slots, the spells that you are carrying the correct tokens for are also added to your known/prepared spells without counting towards the limit of known/prepared spells.

### Ley Line Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Mana Burn
At 24th level, you can try to use your magical endurance and mastery of holding onto and slowly channeling energy during ritual magic to overwhelm what the average 'one pump chump' caster can handle. 

As a reaction to seeing a creature cast a spell, you can deal force damage to it equal to `the level of the highest spell that creature can cast × any unspent Fountain of Magic charges you have`, this damage ignores immunity to force damage. If this damage would force a saving throw to maintain concentration, that creature has disadvantage on the save.

Using this ability reset the 10 minutes you can hold onto Fountain of Magic charges without taking damage. You must finish a long rest before you can use this ability again.

### Planeswalking
At 25th level, you can cast the Dream of the Blue Veil spell as a ritual. 

Additionally, once per session, when you are reduced to 0 hitpoints or immediately before you would suffer a 3rd failed death save, you can choose to teleport to one of your ritual circles from Ley Line Zoning Law. You arrive unconcious, but stable.
