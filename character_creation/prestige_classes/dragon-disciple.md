## Dragon Disciple
*Those who embrace a draconic master learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their masters, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and—at the pinnacle of their abilities—assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.*
