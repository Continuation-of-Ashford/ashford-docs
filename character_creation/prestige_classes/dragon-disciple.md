## Dragon Disciple
*Those who embrace a draconic master to learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their masters, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and—at the pinnacle of their abilities—assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.*

### Draconic Transformation
At 21st level, your body transforms to embody the spirits of the dragons you honor. You gain a new resource called Draconic Essence. You start with an amount equal to your level plus any breath weapon charges you may have and regain all expended Draconic Essence when you complete a short or long rest. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose one of the following options according to the following table, expending Draconic Essence according to the cost noted (no action required). The effects of these features end after one minute. Bonuses from using a transformation multiple times in one minute stack.

| Name | Cost | Effect |
|:------|:-----|:-------|
|Draconic Flight| 4 Draconic Essence | You gain a 60 ft. fly speed. If you already have a fly speed, your fly speed increases by 30 ft. instead.      |
| Breath Weapon | 2 Draconic Essence  | You gain charges equal to the Draconic Essence spent. You can then expend all charges to use your breath weapon or keep charging. When you use your breath weapon, it takes the shape of either a 150-foot, 10-foot wide line or a 90-foot cone. All creatures within the area of the breath weapon must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes damage equal to a number of d10s equal the amount of Draconic Essence expended squared, or half as much on a successful saving throw. The damage type is the same as your teacher's breath (see the table above).
| Claw of the Wyrm | 1 Draconic Essence | Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. You immediately make an unarmed strike against a creature within 10 ft. of you. On a hit, the target takes 6d8 + your Strength modifier magical slashing damage.  |
| Frightful Presence      | 6 Draconic Essence | You make your full might apparent to all enemies. All creatures that can see or hear you within 120 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is frightened. A frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, a creature is no longer frightened. If you have the Dragon Fear feat, you can expend a usage of your Dragonborn Breath Weapon trait to force creatures to make this saving throw at disadvantage or to ignore immunity to the frightened condition.      |
| Draconic Constitution     | 2 Draconic Essence   | Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. Your size increases by one category, to a maximum of Gargantuan.   |


### Maw, Claw, and Tail
Starting at 22nd level, you deal an additional 2d6 damage, the type of which corresponds to your Dragon Ancestry, when you hit a target with an attack. Additionally, once per turn, when you hit a creature, you can knock the target prone or grapple it (escape DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus).

### Draconic Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Draconic Boon
At 24th level, your teacher imparts a [boon](boons.md) of your choice.

### True Draconic Form
At 25th level, you better embody your draconic nature. The abilities from Draconic Transformation improve in the following ways. 
| Name |  Improvement |
|:------|:-------|
|Draconic Flight| When your fly speed reaches  90 ft., you do not provoke attacks of opportunity while flying. When it reaches 120 ft., you benefit from the effects of the Freedom of Movement spell.     |
| Breath Weapon | You can expend 2-4 Draconic Essence per round you charge this ability. |
| Claw of the Wyrm | You can spend an additional Draconic Essence to make an additional Claw attack.  |
| Frightful Presence      | You may choose to charm enemies instead of frightening them. While charmed, they will not harm you or your allies. You can direct a charmed creature to take an action of your choice (no action required). If they fail a Wisdom saving throw, they will carry out the command to the best of their ability on their next turn. If they succeed the saving throw, your Frightful Presence effect on them ends.       |
| Draconic Constitution     |  When you use Draconic Constitution, as a reaction to being hit by an attack, you can spend 2 Draconic Essence to harden your scales. Until the start of your next turn, you add your Constitution modifier to your AC, including against the triggering attack.   |
