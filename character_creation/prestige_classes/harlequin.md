## Harlequin
*You've got all these idiots, wasting so much on silly rituals to give themselves godlike powers, none of which could possibly work. Instead of all that effort trying to lift yourself up, just lower the bar. Come up with something you can do, but that a god can't do, and BOOM! More powerful than a god; easy right?*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:                   
Any level 20 Ashford character that antagonizes an archdemon, exasperates an elder thing, or causes a deity to dismay. It's not just picking a rival, itâ€™s about getting them riled up, getting them to admit that *specifically you* annoy them, even if it's just a little bit. 

##### Hit Points
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Dexterity, Intelligence, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Sleight of Hand, Stealth, or Performance. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma. 
- **Skills:** Choose 1 from Deception, Stealth, Sleight of Hand or Performance.

### Legendary Prankster
At 21st level, *if you simply don't take your enemies seriously, then they aren't a serious threat. You are uniquely suited to make light of even the direst life or death situations.* 

A number of times per day equal to your Dexterity of Charisma modifier (whichever is higher), you can use an action to make a Charisma (performance) or Dexterity (sleight of hand) check and cast 1 of these spells as part of a trick, using the result of your check as the spell DC. When casting as part of a trick, you ignore the spell's normal cast time, the spell does not require concentration, verbal or somatic components, or a spell slot. 

If a creature fails its saving throw against a spell you cast in this way, it flies into a blind rage as ghostly voices taunt and jeer it. For one minute, it has the Blinded condition and, on each of its turns, will only move towards the closest creature and make a melee attack against it. At the end of each of its turns, it may make a Wisdom saving throw, ending this effect on a success.

| Spell Level | Bonus Spells | 
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| 1st | Grease, Tasha's Hideous Laughter | 
| 2nd | Nathair's Mischief, Pyrotechnics |
| 3rd | Glyph of Warding, Stinking Cloud |
| 4th | Compulsion, Watery Sphere |
| 5th | Dream, Seeming |

If you are able to cast spells, these spells are added to your spells known or prepared.

### Never Punished
At 22nd level, *it does not seem like you will learn your lesson any time soon. You avoid death through what appears to others as be pure luck.* You have advantage on death saving throws. Additionally, while you are conscious, you have the following benefits.

- You are immune to damage from the following sources:
    - Falling from a great height
    - Traps whose trigger you know about and that you have triggered intentionally
    - Spells you cast, on the round you cast them
    - Entering or ending your turn in hazardous terrain or effects
    - Attacks of opportunity
- Your soul is incredibly slippery. If you die and are not resurrected, you may spend one downtime slipping from Death's shackles back to life on the Material Plane. You inhabit your body or create a new one if your body was destroyed. The only thing that can stop you from resurrecting in this way is old age; not even the Wish spell or the intervention of a deity can keep you dead.

This seems like sheer dumb luck to other creatures unless they are also a Harlequin; they are not aware you gain the benefits of this ability.

### Ability Score Improvement                   
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat. 

### Stolen blessing
At 24th level, you steal a [blessing](blessings.md) and grant it to yourself. How? Well, that is a very funny story actually...

Choose a specific deity or archdemon whose divine realm, or layer of the Abyss, you can never, ever return to. If you somehow end up there, you and anyone traveling alongside you with the same portal or spell is instantly returned to whatever plane you left from. Upon returning to the plane, you are all subjected to the Teleport spell, targeting a False destination.
                
### The Last Laugh
At 25th level, whenever you make a  Charisma (performance) or Dexterity (sleight of hand) check*, you can choose to make it a Last Laugh. If you do so, creatures of your choice within 30ft of you must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the result of your check. On a failed save, each takes lighting, fire, or thunder damage (your choice) equal to your maximum HP minus however much HP you had before you used this ability. Creatures that succeed the saving throw take half as much damage.

After making a Last Laugh, you immediately fall to 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you must roll initiative or be restored to at least half your maximum hit points before you can use it again.
