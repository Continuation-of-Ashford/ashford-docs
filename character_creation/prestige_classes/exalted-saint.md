### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that willingly binds themselves into the service of one benevolent god. Though there is no alignment prerequisite to become an Exalted Saint, starting the path to sainthood requires acts of great charity and seflessness, shifting your alignment to Good.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from History, Insight, or Religion. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.


### Angelic Weapons					
At 21st level, your attacks become shrouded in a sheath of divine light, as the power of your deity radiates out from your hands. When you deal damage by hitting with an attack roll, the target takes an additional 2d6 radiant damage.

If you lack the Spellcasting and Pact Magic class features, the amount of radiant damage increases to 4d6 and is dealt to all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the original target. In addition, if you meet this condition and hit a creature with an attack, you can pick one creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class features, whenever you target a friendly creature with a spell, that creature regains 2d6 hit points.

### Endless Worship				
Also at 21st level, your devotion to your patron has garnered special attention, even amongst their most ardent followers. As such, they grant you an additional measure of divine power. You always have the benefits of a 9th level Death Ward spell cast upon you each day at dawn. If the Death Ward is consumed or dispelled, you regain it after one minute. While benefitting from a Death Ward spell, you do not age.

Additionallly, you can entreat your deity to bless your party once per day. You can cast a special version of Bless at 9th level; this version has a duration of 1 hour, does not require your concentration, cannot be dispelled, and persists in anti-magic zones.

### Healing Touch
You learn the Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Revivify, Mass Healing Word, and Heal spells. Wisdom is your spellcasting abillity for these spells. You gain the ability to cast each of these spells once without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.

When you cast one of these spells using this feature, you may end one condition affecting that creature and the amount of healing increases by your level, or twice your level if the target is dead.

### Divine Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Divine Blessing					
At 24th level, you choose a benevolent god that grants you a sliver of their divinity. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that your patron grants you. 

### Angelic Form
At 25th level, you also become resistant to fire and radiant damage. 

Additionally, you grow a pair of angelic wings, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed or 60 ft., whichever is higher. You can use a bonus action to hide or manifest these wings. Any armor or clothing you wear must be designed to accomodate the wings or be torn apart when the wings are summoned. If you already have wings, this extra pair will appear behind your original wings, and your flying speed is increased by 30 feet.

When you summon these wings, all creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have one), becoming charmed or frightened by you on a failed saving throw. A creature affected in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
