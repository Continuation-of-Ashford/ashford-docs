## Legendary Commander
*You understand that those hoarding great power only for themselves will ultimately achieve nothing. Insurmountable power can come only from cooperation, coordination and unity! Through deep interpersonal connections, and a supernatural training regimen, you have drilled over a thousand volunteers to be every bit as powerful as you are. Your legion will be your legacy, as a unit capable of far more than any single adventurer could ever be.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that possesses a fortress stronghold in which they can train their legion.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** None
- **Skills:** Persuasion and Intimidation. (If you are already proficient in both, you instead gain a skill of your choice)

### Banner of the Legion
At 21st level, you imbue one banner bearing the symbol of your legion with the courage and confidence of the legion. Turning into an artifact magic item. 

Like any Artifact, your banner is unaffected by Anti-magic field and is immune to damage. *Part of the cloth, that contains the symbol is also self-cleaning.* However, when there is no living humanoid that was trained at your stronghold within 100ft of the banner, it loses this immunity. 

While the banner in immune to damage, a creature holding the banner in one hand can use it as a shield. The bonus to AC for this shield equals half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) 

### Stand United
*The word "legion" means "thousands", while it might not be entirely literal, you do have a lot of humanoids training at your stronghold.* You are free to bring a couple with you while adventuring (no more than 3) but most of your legion should always be busy making sure the number of them doesn't decrease.

- Your legionaries will not move further than 100ft from your banner. If they start their turn more than 100 feet away, they will only take the dash action to move closer to it.
- In combat, they will follow your commands (no action required).
- Your legionaries have maximum hitpoints equal to `your maximum hitpoints, divided by the number of legionaries you brought`.
- When you spend hit dice during a short rest, you can choose for one of your legionaires to gain hit points instead of yourself. 
- Your legionaries use your ability scores and proficiency bonus when making attacks rolls, determining DCs, and making saving throws.  They are proficient in the same skills and saving throws as you.    
- Your legionaries do not make skill checks, but can still use the Help action to give advantage on a skill check.
- Your legionaries are proficient with the same equipment you are proficient in. (Though you'll need to supply them with armor and weapons yourself)
- If you have the Martial Arts, Unarmored Defense and/or Fighting Style features, your legionaries also have these. Your legionaries don't inherit any other class features or feats from you.
- Your legionaries can be of a different race than you and have their own racial traits. However, their ability scores are unchanged by their race (and racial traits that grant a feat don't work for them). 
- In combat your legionaries take their turn immediately after yours.    
- Each legionary can make only 1 attack per turn (If they cast a spell that makes multiple attacks, such as Scorching Ray, any attacks after the first are wasted). 
- Your legionaries have half as many spell slots as you do (rounded down), divided between themselves, up to a maximum of 8 each. Calulate this number by starting with your 1st level spell slots, then count upwards, until you either reach 8 or half the total number of spell slots you have. If this would grant your pact magic spell slots to your legionaries, those pact magic slots are at most 3rd level for them and restore on a long rest.    
-- `i.e., of the three legionairies following a 20th level wizard, two would have  4 1st level slots and one would have 3 1st level slots.  The singular legionairy following a paladin would have 4 1st level slots and 3 2nd level slots.`
For the purpose of cantrip scaling, the legionaries are 1st level.
- Your legionaries know and prepare the same spells as you do, but can only cast spells they have spell slots for. They cannot cast ritual spells or spells from scrolls.

### Perfect Command
At 22nd level, *the banner of the legion exudes such unity, that even the untrained begin moving in perfect formation.*   
While holding your banner you can use the Activate Magic item action to give Perfect Commands to allied creatures that can hear you or see you.
The Perfect Commands are as follows:

* ***Shake it off!***    
Pick one condition or ongoing magical effect afflicting one of your allies. If the effect can be ended by an ability check, that ally gets to make that check immediately without spending an action. If the effect was causes by failing a saving throw, that ally can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Saving throws and ability checks prompted by this ability receive a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.  
* ***Charge!***    
Pick a number of allies up to your proficiency bonus. They can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking attacks of opportunity, then make an melee attack.
* ***Bombard!***   
Pick one or two allies. They can use their reaction to take the attack action with a ranged weapon or cast an evocation spell of 3rd level or lower.
* ***On your feet!***   
When an ally drops to 0hp or dies, you can use a reaction to shout words whose inspiration alone inspire them to keep fighting.  They can use a reaction to spend up to 2 of their hit dice and regain hitpoints equal to the result of the dice + their Constitution modifier for each die spent. They can stand up from being prone as part of the same reaction.
This feature can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

You can give Perfect Commands a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Whenever you complete a long rest, you regain these uses.

### Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### We are Legion
Also at 24th level, *your soul and the soul of every member of your legion is bound to the banner.* So long as the banner is not destroyed, souls bound to it cannot be trapped or destroyed in a way that would prevent resurrection.

If you are dead, any willing humanoid trained at your stronghold can use the banner using the Activate Magic Item action to *"become the Legendary Commander"*. This process takes three rounds, during which the creature cannot move or take actions and must concentrate on like a spell. Their ideals, bonds, flaws, character traits, proficiencies, ability scores, and features become yours.  This functions similar to the Reincarnate spell, but instead of creating a new body, the humanoid activating the item gives up their body for you to inhabit.

<!-- 
### Blessed Legion
At 24th level, you gain one [blessing](./blessings.md).

If this blessing can be activated using any type of action, the legionaries from Stand United can also activate this blessing. If the chosen blessing can be activated a limited number of times per rest, the legion's uses of it deduct from your own.
-->

### Inspiring Loyalty
At 25th level, *your presence and leadership inspires those around you to greatness, including off the battlefield.* Every time you take a downtime at the settlement you built your stronghold in, your followers will work alongside you, performing the same downtime within the settlement using the same ability modifiers you might use. If this costs gold, the cost is reduced by 2k from taxes contributed to the project.
