## Legendary Commander
*You understand that those hoarding great power only for themselves will ultimately achieve nothing. Insurmountable power can come only from cooperation, coordination and unity! Through deep interpersonal connections, and a supernatural training regimen, you have drilled over a thousand volunteers to be every bit as powerful as you are. Your legion will be your legacy, as a unit capable of far more than any single adventurer could ever be.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
Any level 20 Ashford character that possesses a fortress stronghold in which they can train their legion.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Insight, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Banner of the Legion
At 21st level, you imbue one banner bearing the symbol of your legion with the courage and confidence of the legion. The banner turns into an artifact rarity magic item. 

Like any Artifact, your banner is unaffected by effects that disable magic and is immune to damage. The part of the cloth that contains the symbol is magically self-cleaning. 

The banner can either be affixed to a polearm, used as a shield, or used as a cape.
 - While used as a shield, its shield bonus to AC equals 2 plus half your proficiency bonus. 
 - While affixed to a polearm, each time you hit a hostile creature with an attack with that weapon, one friendly creature you can see regains HP equal to your proficiency bonus.
 - While worn as a cape, you are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions. Additionally, you regain HP equal to your proficiency bonus at the start of your turn as long as one of your legionnaires is alive and within 100 feet of you.

 If you are mounting a creature, that creature can also gain the shield bonus to AC or the condition immunity and HP regeneration of the shield or cape form of the banner.

### Stand United
*The word "legion" means "thousands", while it might not be entirely literal, you do have a lot of humanoids training at your stronghold.* You are free to bring a up to three legionnaires with you while adventuring, but most of your legion should always be busy making sure the number of them doesn't decrease.

- If you have the Extra Attack feature, you may bring Knight Legionnaires.
- If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features, you may bring Mage Legionnaires.
- If you have the Sneak Attack or Favored Enemy/Foe features, you may bring Scout Legionnaires.

### We are Legion
Also at 21st level, *your soul and the soul of every member of your legion is bound to the banner.* So long as the banner is not destroyed, souls bound to it cannot be trapped or destroyed in a way that would prevent resurrection.

If you are dead, any willing humanoid trained at your stronghold can use the banner using the Activate Magic Item action to *"become the Legendary Commander"*. The humanoid must concentrate on this ability like a spell until the start of its next turn. After the start of its next turn, their ideals, bonds, flaws, character traits, proficiencies, ability scores, and non-racial features are replaced by yours and you take control of that humanoid.  This functions similar to the Reincarnate spell, but instead of creating a new body, the humanoid activating the item gives up their body for you to inhabit.

### Perfect Command
At 22nd level, *the banner of the legion exudes such unity, that even the untrained begin moving in perfect formation.*   
While holding your banner you can use a bonus action to give Perfect Commands to allied creatures that can hear you or see you.
The Perfect Commands are as follows:

* ***Shake it off!***    
Pick one condition or ongoing magical effect afflicting your allies. If the effect can be ended by an ability check, allies affected by it get to make that check immediately without spending an action. If the effect was caused by failing a saving throw, affected allies can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Saving throws and ability checks prompted by this ability receive a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.  
* ***Charge!***    
Your Legionnaires and a number of your other allies up to your proficiency bonus can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking attacks of opportunity, then make a melee attack.
* ***Bombard!***   
Your Legionnaires and one or two of your other allies can use their reaction to take the attack action with a ranged weapon or cast an evocation spell of 4th level or lower that deals damage.
* ***On your feet!***   
When an ally drops to 0 hit points or dies, you can use a reaction to shout encouraging words with such powerful conviction they rise again to keep fighting. The target immediately rises with HP equal to twice your level and loses the prone condition.
This feature can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.
* ***Lock Shields!***
Until the end of your next turn, your Legionaires and a number of other allies up to your proficiency bonus can use a reaction to double their shield's bonus to their AC (or 2 if they do not wield a shield) for one turn when hit by an attack. The bonus to AC applies to the attack, potentially causing it to miss.
* ***Brace for Impact!***
Until the end of your next turn, your Legionaires and a number of other allies up to your proficiency bonus can use a reaction to brace themselves against an oncoming blow. Against an attack, they force it to roll at disadvantage and gain resistance to any damage caused by the attack. Against a saving throw, they gain advantage on the saving throw and take no damage if they succeed the saving throw and half as much damage if they fail.
* ***Double Time!***
You can order those under your command to move at supernatural speeds. Outside of initiative, you can cast the Teleport spell targeting your Legionnaires and a number of your other allies up to your proficiency bonus.
When used inside initiative, your Legionnaires and a number of your other allies up to your proficiency bonus can take the Dodge and Dash actions at no action cost.

You can give Perfect Commands a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Whenever you complete a long rest, you regain these uses.

### Ability Score Improvement                   
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat. 

### Blessing of Command

At 24th level, you gain a [Blessing](blessings.md).

### Inspiring Loyalty
At 25th level, *your presence and leadership inspires those around you to greatness, including off the battlefield.* Every time you take a downtime at the settlement you built your stronghold in, your legion will work alongside you, effectively granting you one additional downtime.

Additionally, when you take an action on your turn, your legionnaires can use a reaction to immediately take the same action themselves if it is possible for them to take that action.
