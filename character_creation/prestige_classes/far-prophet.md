##### Bonus Proficiencies

### Peer Beyond The Veil
At 21st level, your powers of perception have exceeded those of mere mortals, allowing you to see the truths lying just beneath the surface.  You gain the following benefits.
- You gain Truesight, Blindsight, and Tremorsense to a range of 30 feet. 
- You know when you hear a lie and the answer to every riddle you hear.
- You can know the location of every secret door, trap, and creature within 30 feet of you.

### Ear Against The Wall
Also at 21st level, the voices of unknowable beings constantly whisper to you.  Sometimes they are even helpful!  You gain proficiency in one skill.  You can accept one random form of long-term madness to gain proficiency in another skill so long as you suffer from that form of madness. If you already have that madness, or if you do not wish to suffer that madness, you do not gain the proficiency or the madness. The madness and skill proficiency last until you take a long rest.  The madness received from this or similar features cannot be removed by magic like restoration. 

You can use this feature once every ten minutes.

You gain 1 form of indefinite madness: *"They are trying to get in they are trying to get in they are trying to get in they are trying to get in they are trying to get in-"*

### Blessing From Beyond The Stars
At 22nd level, you gain one [blessing](./blessings.md) from a Far Realm-infested Star.

You gain 1 form of indefinite madness: *"Your chosen star is a beacon of safety in a world gone mad."*
 
### Ability Score Improvement
At 23rd level, you realize that your mortal shell is capable of far more than it should be and resculpt it into what it should be. You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.

### Final Understanding
At 24th level, you finally comprehend what the voices meant to tell you! You gain the following benefits.
- You gain proficiency in all skills. When you use your **Ear Against The Wall** feature, you instead gain expertise in the chosen skill.
- Your weapon attacks and spells deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage per madness you are suffering.
- Pick one ability score. Ability checks made with that score are made at advantage.

In addition, while suffering from madness, you can ignore one enemy's resistance or immunity to psychic damage and immunities to the charmed and frightened conditions.  You can ignore the resistances and immunities of 4 creatures this way per long rest.

You gain 1 form of indefinite madness: *"It is not you that is mad, it is everyone else."*

### Word Of The Prophet
At 25th level, your  mind serves as a gateway to the Far Realms. You gain the following benefits.
- You can cast Gate once per day and make a Wisdom (Insight) check. The Gate can only lead to a location within the Far Realms. On the next round at initiative count 10, an aberration of your choice whose CR is less than half the result will emerge through the Gate. The aberration is friendly to you and will defend you and your allies to its best ability, but it is not under your control.

- You can use a bonus action to tell a maddening truth to a creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you and understand a language you speak. It must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have one. On a faillure, it becomes frightened by you. While frightened in this way, it cannot move and or use actions besides the Attack or Multiattack action, choosing itself as the target. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn if it has dealt at least 50 damage to itself that round, ending this effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours. 

You gain 1 form of indefinite madness: *"Only you can save this doomed world."*
