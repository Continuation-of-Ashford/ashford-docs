### Ear Against The Wall
Also at 21st level, the voices of unknowable beings constantly whisper to you.  Sometimes they are even helpful!  You gain proficiency in one skill.  You can accept one random form of long-term madness to gain proficiency in another skill. The madness and skill proficiency last either 1 hour or until you take a short or long rest, whichever is shorter.  The madness received from this or similar features cannot be removed prematurely by magic like restoration.

Alternatively, you can take a feat.

### Final Understanding
At 24th level, you finally comprehend what the voices meant to tell you! Your weapon attacks and spells deal an additional 1d4 psychic damage per madness you are suffering.

You gain 1 form of indefinite madness: *"It is not you that is mad, it is everyone else."*

### Word Of The Prophet
At 25th level, Your  mind serves as a gateway to the Far Realms. You can cast Gate once per day, but it can only open somewhere within the Far Realms.  

In addition, while suffering from madness, you can ignore one enemies' resistance to psychic damage and immunities to the charmed and frightened conditions.  You can ignore the resistances and immunities of 4 creatures this way per long rest.
