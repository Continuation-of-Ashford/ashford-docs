### Prestige Class Prerequisites: 
A character who has traveled through the Far Realms for one week.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, Deception, Insight, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Ear Against The Wall
At 21st level, you receive guidance from those who exist outside the boundaries of mortal perception or knowledge. You gain the following benefits.
- You become immune to the paralyzed, frightened, deafened, charmed, and blinded conditions.
- Once per combat, when you make a saving throw, attack roll, or ability check, you can roll another d20, choosing the outcome from all rolled d20s.

### Otherworldly Ascension
Beginning at 22nd level, you ensconse your mind in the Far Realm, instead using an avatar to interact with the mundane world. If you die, your body and equipment explodes into a reality-warping bubble of unreality, with a warped shadow of your mind in the center, which you take control of. All creatures within 30 feet of you when you die must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have a spell save DC), taking 12d6 psychic damage on a failed saving throw, or half on a successful one. A creature which fails this saving throw is then pulled 15 feet towards the shadow of your mind on a failed saving throw. 

This shadow of your mind cannot be targeted by any means, has a 30 ft. fly (hover) speed, truesight to a range of 120 ft., and telepathy out to 120 ft. You remain in control of this shadow until it is targeted by a spell which would restore a creature from death to life or the session ends (see below). For one minute thereafter, a 30-foot radius around your shadow is difficult terrain. The only action you can take in this state are Warp Reality and Multiattack, as shown below.  The shadow cannot move further than 60 feet from where your avatar died.

#### Warp Reality
As a bonus action to teleport any number of other creatures within 30 feet of you to another location within 30 feet of you. 

#### Multiattack
You make two Mind Blast attacks.

##### Mind Blast
 Ranged Spell Attack: your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6d8 + proficiency bonus psychic damage.  The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have a spell save DC) or be charmed or frightened by your shadow until the end of your next turn.

If this shadow of your mind is targeted by a spell which would restore a creature to life, such as Revivify, Raise Dead, or True Resurrection within the appropriate timeframe of the spell, your avatar is returned to life as if you had died and been resurrected normally, with your body and equipment reforming intact. If the session ends without your shadow being targeted by one of these spells, you take disadvantage on your next downtime check in exchange for your body and equipment reforming intact as if you had been targeted by such a spell at the start of the next session you participate in.

### Ability Score Improvement
At 23rd level, you realize that your mortal shell is capable of far more than it should be and resculpt it into what it should be. You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.

Alternatively, you can take a feat.

### Far Blessing
At 24th level, you gain one [blessing](./blessings.md) from a Far Realm-infested Star.

This blessing will often come with a form of indefinite madness, such as *"Your chosen star is a beacon of safety in a world gone mad."*

### Final Understanding
At 25th level, you finally comprehend what the voices meant to tell you! You gain the following benefits.
- You gain proficiency in all skills. 
- Pick one ability score. Ability checks made with that score are made at advantage.
- You ignore a creature's resistance or immunity to pyschic damage and the charmed and frightened conditions. inflicting a creature with the charmed or frightened condition, you ignore the target's immunity or resistance.
- You can use your action to open a portal to the Far Realm. Three aberrations of your choice whose CR is less than 10 appear in the closest unoccupied locations to that portal. These aberrations obey your telepathic orders (no action required by you) and take their turns immediately after yours. They disappear back through the portal if they are reduced to 0 hit points or one minute passes. After one minute passes, the portal disappears. No creatures aside from these aberrations can pass through this portal.
