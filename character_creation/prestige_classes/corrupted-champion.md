## Corrupted Champion
*Mortals can become tainted by the lower planes when they bargain with devils for power or when they are exposed to the effects of demonic corruption. High level adventurers have experience with the temptation and corruption inherent to fiends. Yet some adventurers believe the potential power to be gained is worth the risk. They believe they'll be able to resist the influence of the lower planes, and gain great power.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that accepts a contract with a devil or decides to imbibe demonic ichor.

There is no Alignment prerequisite for this Prestige Class, but power corrupts, shifting your alignment to Evil. 

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Constitution, Strength, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Deception or Intimidation. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Demonic Strength
At 21st level, your Charisma score is increased to 20 if it is not already higher. Additionally, you add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to any melee attack attack roll, saving throw, or ability check you make using your Strength modifier. If you hit a creature with an attack roll that uses your Strength modifier for its attack and damage rolls, you can move the target up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice. This strength likely changes your body in a permanent way, granting you fiend-like features such as permanently clammy skin, black voids for eyes, or demonic horns.

### Variable Resistance
At 22nd level, as a reaction when you make a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, you can give yourself advantage on the saving throw. Additionally, you have advantage on any saving throw you make against and resistance to damage from any effect that does that same damage type until you use this reaction again.

### Fiendish Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Corrupted Boon
At 24th level, you may take one [boon](boons.md).
Choose whether your boon comes from a deal with a devil or from being infected with demonic taint. Your new found fiendish power gives you a permanent magic aura detectable by effects like Divine Sense, hinting at your connection to the lower planes. 

### Aura of Corruption
At 25th level, you gain the ability to force creatures to their knees in your presence. If a creature begins its turn within 15 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have one). On a failed saving throw, it falls prone, kneeling. Additionally, whether the creature succeeds or fails, it takes 4d8 psychic or necrotic damage (your choice). You can dispel or activate this aura as a bonus action. When you activate this aura, you can select any number of creatures to be unaffected.
