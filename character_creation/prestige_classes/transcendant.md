### Ascetic's Blessing
At 21st level, *you understand enough about yourself and about the universe that you can grant a blessing*. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that you grant to yourself. 

During a long rest, you and one other creature can meditate on this blessing. If you do, you lose the effects of the blessing and bestow them upon the other creature instead. This ability ends after you take a long rest or if you use an action to end it early.

### Transcend Materialism
At 22nd level, when you attune to a magic item that isn't Legendary or an Artifact, doesn't have charges and isn't already spiritual essence, you can choose to transform that item into it's spiritual essence. Turning an item into essence renders the original item non-magical.

As an action you can summon a weightless semi-transparent copy that has the properties of the original item. These copies can be dismissed after they are summoned (no action required). If you create a 2nd copy of an item the previous one is automatically dismissed.

You can use Spiritual Essences in the following ways:
- When you summon an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can attune to it and equip it as part of the action used to summon it.
- When you dismiss an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can unattune from it as part of dismissing it.
- Attunment to an item of Spiritial Essense does not end when the attuned creature dies.
- Even when you lose attunement to such a copy (such as when another creature attunes to it) you are still able to dismiss the copy and create a new one.
- If the original item was cursed to make you unwilling to part with it, you are also unwilling to dismiss its copy.

### Enlightened Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Spiritual Ascension
At 24th level, whenever you make a Death Saving Throw, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

While you are at 0 hp or dead, you magically control an ethereal projection that appears above your body and cannot move or be moved. The projection is an object that is immune to all damage and conditions, possesses your memories and abilities, looks identical to you, can perceive its surroundings, and speak.  This allows you to attempt certain Ability checks while dead or dying, but you cannot interact with its surroundings in any physical way, other than by using Items of Spiritual Essence. The projection can summon and use your Items of Spiritual Essence (including making attacks with any summoned weapons) it can also make unarmed attacks that deal Force instead of Bludgeoning damage.

### Spiritual Displacement
At 25th level, as an action you can make an special unarmed strike that deals no damage against a creature. If this attack hits, the target must make a Charisma Saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the highest of your Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma modifier). On a failed save the target is pushed 50ft away from you and thrown into the border Ethereal, but it leaves behind an incapacitated and prone copy of its body. 
Attacks and spells that hit the body also hit the creature in the Ethereal plane but items cannot be taken off the body.

While within the border Ethereal the target can see into the plane it was thrown out of. The only actions it can take are the Dash Action or reenter its body as an action if it is adjacent it. When it reenters the body, all of these effects end.
