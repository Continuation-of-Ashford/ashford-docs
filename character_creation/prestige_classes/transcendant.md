### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that has meditated in the Astral Sea, Ethereal Plane, and Limbo.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose any one skill proficiency. 
- **Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, Investigation, History, Insight, or Perception. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Immortal Arts
At 21st level, you have gained understanding of some fundamental essence of this world. If an Immortal Art calls for a saving throw, it uses your Ki save DC. An Artâ€™s Action Cost is the time you must spend activating the art, its Duration is how long its effects last. If it has a duration of a number of rounds, it lasts until the end of your next turn after the specified number of times initiative cycles back to the top. If an Art calls for an area of effect, use the Areas of Effect rules for spellcasting, PHB p. 204.

You can select one Immortal Art at each level you take in this class, with a list located at the end of this page. You must select an Art whose level requirement matches the level at which you are choosing the Art. You can use each Art once per long rest.



### Transcend Materialism
Also at 21st level, when you attune to a magic item that isn't Legendary or an Artifact, doesn't have charges and isn't already spiritual essence, you can choose to transform that item into its spiritual essence. Turning an item into essence renders the original item non-magical.

As an action you can summon a weightless semi-transparent copy that has the properties of the original item. These copies can be dismissed after they are summoned (no action required). If you create a 2nd copy of an item the previous one is automatically dismissed.

You can use Spiritual Essences in the following ways:
- When you summon an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can attune to it and equip it as part of the action used to summon it.
- When you dismiss an item of Spiritial Essense that requires attunement, you can unattune from it as part of dismissing it.
- Attunment to an item of Spiritial Essense does not end when the attuned creature dies.
- When you attune to an item of Spiritual Essence, you can also allow up to three willing creatures you can see to gain the item's effects as long as you are attuned to it. 
- Even when you lose attunement to such a copy (such as when another creature attunes to it) you are still able to dismiss the copy and create a new one.
- If the original item was cursed to make you unwilling to part with it, you are also unwilling to dismiss its copy. This curse does not extend to other creatures who benefit from the item.


### Spiritual Ascension
At 22nd level, whenever you make a Death Saving Throw, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

While you are at 0 hp or dead, you magically control an ethereal projection that appears above your body and cannot move, be moved, or teleport. The projection is an object you control that is immune to all damage and conditions, possesses your memories and abilities, looks identical to you, can perceive its surroundings, and speak.  This allows you to attempt certain Ability checks while dead or dying, but you cannot interact with its surroundings in any physical way, other than by using Items of Spiritual Essence. The projection can summon and use your Items of Spiritual Essence (including making attacks with any summoned weapons). It can also make unarmed attacks that deal Force instead of Bludgeoning damage.

This projection stays at its location until you are resurrected. It counts as your intact body for the purposes of resurrection spells like Revivify or Resurrection. Should your soul not be available for resurrection, this object can take its place.

### Enlightened Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Ascetic's Boon
At 24th level, you may take one [boon](boons.md). You may choose for the creature that benefits from your Ascetic's blessing to benefit from this boon instead of you.

### Spiritual Displacement
At 25th level, you can can make an special unarmed strike that deals no damage against a creature. If this attack hits, the target must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have a spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is pushed 120ft away from you and thrown into the border Ethereal, but it leaves behind an incapacitated and prone copy of its body. 
Attacks and spells that hit the body also hit the creature in the Ethereal plane but items cannot be taken off the body.

While within the border Ethereal the only actions the target can take are the Dash Action or reenter its body, ending this effect, if it is in the same relative position in the Ethereal Plane as its body is in the Material Plane. After a creature succeeds the saving throw or reenters its body, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.
