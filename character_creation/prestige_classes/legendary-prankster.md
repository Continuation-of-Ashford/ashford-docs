## Legendary Prankster
*You've got all these idiots, wasting so much on silly rituals to give themselves godlike powers, none of which could possibly work. Instead of all that effort trying to lift yourself up, just lower the bar. Come up with something you can do, but that a god can't do, and BOOM! More powerful than a god; easy right?*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that antagonizes an archdemon, exasperates an elder thing, or causes a deity to dismay. It's not just picking a rival, its about getting them riled up, getting them to admit that *specifically you* annoy them, even if it's just a little bit. 

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** none
- **Skills:** Choose 1 from Deception, Stealth, Sleight of Hand or Performance.

### Legendary Prankster
At 21st level, *if you simply don't take your enemies seriously, then they aren't a serious threat. You are uniquely suited to make light of even the most dire life or death situations.* You have a list of bonus spells that are added to the spell lists for any spell casting class you might have. 

Up to 5 times per day, you can use an action to make a Charisma(performance) or Dexterity(sleight of hand) check and cast 1 of these spells as part of the trick, using the result of your check as the spell DC. When casting as part of a prank, you ignore the spell's normal cast time, the spell does not require concentration, and requires no components except material.

| Spell Level | Bonus Spells | 
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| 1st | Grease, Tasha's Hideous Laughter | 
| 2nd | Nathair's Mischief, Pyrotechnics |
| 3rd | Glyph of Warding, Stinking Cloud |
| 4th | Compulsion, Watery Sphere |
| 5th | Dream, Seeming |

### Never Punished
At 22nd level, *it doesn't seem like you'll learn your lesson any time soon. You avoid death through what appears to be pure luck.* While you are conscious, you have the following benefits.

- You have resistance to damage inflicted due to your own movement or actions such as entering a Wall of Fire, moving through Spike Growth, drinking poison or casting Fireball at your own feet. This will not reduce damage from standing in effects that deal damage for starting or ending your turn in them.
- You have resistance to damage that doesn't originate from a creature, such as falling damage, mechanical traps, or swimming in a pool of acid.
- When you fail a saving throw by 5 or more after accounting for all bonuses, you instead fail the save by exactly 4. 

### Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Stolen blessing
At 24nd level, you steal a [blessing](blessings.md) and grant it to yourself. How? Well that is a very funny story actually...

Choose a specific deity or archdemon whose divine realm, or layer of the Abyss, you can never, ever return to. If you would somehow end up there, you and anyone traveling alongside you using the same portal or spell is instead returned to whatever plane you left from. Upon returning to the plane, you are all subjected to the Teleport spell, targeting a False destination.
				
### The Last Laugh
At 25th level, as an action you make a Charisma(performance) or Dexterity(sleight of hand) check and reduce yourself to 0 HP. Creatures of your choice within 15ft must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the result of your check. On a failed save, each takes lighting, fire or thunder damage (your choice) equal to your maximum HP minus however much HP you had before you used this ability. Creatures that succeed on the save take half as much damage.
