### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character that has an ally in one of the courts of the fey.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Deception, Persuasion, Insight, or Performance. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Eternal King on an Eternal Throne
At 21st level, when you die, an older and more regal version of yourself steps from the mists of time to take your place. This version of you from a possible future, and is a separate creature that appears within 5ft of you. This version of yourself then either absorbs your present self or allows your present self to absorb it. Regardless of the process, you instantly regain all hit points and can immediately take a turn. You can use this feature once per session.

Additionally, your every movement conveys your royal majesty. When you hit a creature with an attack roll, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (or 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus if you do not have a spell save DC) or become frightened for one minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action on its turn and use its movement to move away from you. At the end of each of its turns, a creature frightened in this way can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a successful saving throw.

### Shuffling of the Court
At 22nd level, you can use your reaction to teleport a number of creatures you can see equal to your Charisma modifier up to 60 feet to unoccupied locations you can see in response to one of the teleported creatures being forced to make a saving throw or being targeted by a spell or attack roll. If this would place them outside the range of the attack or effect that forced the saving throw, they are unaffected by it. You can use this feature once before you must roll initiative again to use the feature again.

### Fey Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Fey Blessing					
At 24th level, you draw power from the blood of Correlon that is in the soil of the Feywild. Choose a [blessing](blessings.md) that your domain in the Feywild grants you.

### Dominion over the Mind
At 25th level, once per round when a creature you can see fails an Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a feature to weave fey magic into their misery. Choose one of following effects:
- The target is blinded for one minute.
- The creature which forced the saving throw becomes targeted by their own effect in addition to the original target, making the same saving throw. You can use this option once before you must complete a short or long rest to do so again.
- The target is frightened or charmed (your choice) by you for one minute. It can repeat the triggering saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a successful saving throw.
- One creature of your choice vanishes from the target's perception. The creature is granted full cover against the target, and its location is unknown to the target. The target can use its action to make an Intelligence (Perception) check, contested by the DC of the saving throw of the triggering saving throw. On a successful check, this effect ends. You can use this option once before you must complete a short or long rest to do so again.
