### Prestige Class Prerequisites:
Any level 20 Ashford character that has devoted their lives to defending nature.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Strength, Wisdom, or Intelligence. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Undying Guardian
At 21st level, your vitality has been integrated into your grove, an area of up to one square mile of land you choose to personally guard when you take this class. You are now a Plant.

If you are killed, your body reforms within your grove 2d10 days after your death unless your grove is destroyed. During the next session your character participates in, you have disadvantage on any downtime checks to represent the time spent reforming your body. Because you have already given your soul up to pursue this form of undeath, you are immune to any effect that would prevent your resurrection.
 
Due to your form, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources.
- If your body is in contact with the ground, you regenerate 1 hit point at the start of a turn, and you cannot die while touching the ground. The cause of this inability to die is immediately apprarent. 

### Wrath of Nature
Starting at 22nd level, you add your Wisdom modifier to any attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws you make using your Strength or Consitution modifier. 

Additionally, you can utilize the vines, branches, and roots on your body to make attacks. You gain access to the following attack. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

##### Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 6d8 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. On a hit, the target is grappled by you (escape DC equal to 8 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus). While grappled in this way, the target is restrained, and the target takes 2d6 poison damage whenever it starts its turn. 

### Mossy Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, by growing different colors of moss, you can improve your abilities. Your ability score increases by 2 if you grow one color of moss or by 1 if you grow two colors of moss. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can gain a feat by mixing the moss into a special potion and drinking it.

* If you grow Red moss, you gain Strength.
* If you grow Green moss, you gain Constitution.
* If you grow Black moss, you gain Dexterity.
* If you grow Blue moss, you gain Intelligence.
* If you grow Yellow moss, you gain Wisdom.
* If you grow Pink moss, you gain Charisma.

### Nature's Blessing
At 24nd level, the nature spirits you guard grant you a [blessing](blessings.md).

### Spore Cloud
Starting at 25th level, your body is host to fungi which produce necrotic spores. As a bonus action, you can cause these fungi to radiate spores in a 15-foot radius around you. You can deactivate this aura at will. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn within the area, it must make a Constitution saving throw, the DC of which is equal to your spell save DC, or if you do not have a spell save DC, 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage and is affected by the poisoned condition for one minute. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage and is not poisoned. If a creature which was poisoned in this way ends its turn while not inside this area, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the condition on a successful saving throw.

As an action, you can cause these fungi to produce immunizing spores. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you when you take this action automatically succeed any saving throws against this feature and take no damage on a successful saving throw until they complete a long rest. In addition, immunized creatures have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition and can communicate telpathically with other immunized creatures across any distance until they complete a long rest
