### Prestige Class Prerequisites:
Any level 20 Ashford character that can benefit from double their proficiency bonus to any type of Artisan's tools checks and/or Arcana skill checks when making Ability Checks during downtimes.

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d12	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Strength, Constitution, or Intelligence. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, Investigation, or Medicine. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Mortal Engine
At 21st level, you begin replacing parts of your body with magical items you've crafted. These magic items become Artifact rarity. Like any Artifact, they are unaffected by antimagic fields and can be destroyed only using the tools that created them. The mundane parts of your body you have yet to replace remain susceptible to damage.

Using the Activate Magic Item action your Artifact body allows you to reproduce the effects of several spells. You cast three 1st or 2nd level spells at once that have a range of touch or self and a duration of at least one minute. This does not require any spell slots and does not require concentration. Spells you cast in this way can only affect yourself. Even if you would not be able to cast spells for any reason (i.e. being outside the Crystal Sphere) you may still cast spells with your artifact body.

When you use this feature again, any lingering effects of the previous spells you cast this way end.

Finally, over the course of crafting innumerable magic items, your experience has granted you proficiency in all Artisan's Tools. If you already add your proficiency bonus to checks made with all Artisan's Tools, you add 1d4 to any check you make using Artisan's Tools.

### Invulnerable Anatomy
At 22th level, you have replaced enough of your organs to no longer have any that are considered 'vital'. You gain the following benefits.
- You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws. 
- Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.
- You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned and diseased conditions
- You no longer require food, water, or air to survive.
- You no longer age.

### Artifact Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1 by weaving additional powerful effects into your body. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Craftable Boon
At 24nd level, you upgrade your body to incorporate a [boon](boons.md).

### You V.2
At 25th level, *building on everything you've learned from overhauling your body the first time, there is still so much room for further improvements!* You upgrade each magic item within your body to a more efficient version. Gaining multiple benefits:

- Your hit point maximum increases by 50.
- You can attune to 1 additional item.
- For each unused attunement slot you possess you gain a +1 bonus to AC and Saving throws.
- Choose one Transmutation spell of 6th level or lower that can only affect one creature and has a duration of at least one minute. That spell is permanently cast upon you, cannot be dispelled, and does not require concentration.
