## Dread Lich
*Those that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. Others find the lore elsewhere, hidden within Vecna's cursed memoirs.*

*Those that can bestow immortality always demand a heavy toll for this secret knowledge. Often including the memories of how lichdom is achieved.*

### Prestige Class Prerequisites:					
Any level 20 Ashford character which has the Spellcasting feature.

In order to become a lich you must bargain for the secret rituals with a being of great evil, then sacrifice and consume the soul of another sentient creature. While there is no Alignment prerequisite for starting the path to Lichdom, successfully completing the steps will always alter your alignment to Evil (even if you started on this path with the intention to use the power for the good of others.)

##### Hit Points
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6	
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per prestige level

##### Bonus Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Choose one from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you already have proficiency in all three, you instead gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.
- **Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, History, Medicine, or Religion. You gain proficiency in that skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you double your proficiency bonus when you add it to a check with that skill. If you already do so, you can add 1d4 to any ability check you make using that skill.

### Phylactery		
At 21st level, you perform a ritual to kill your living body and trap your soul within a phylactery. You are now an Undead.   
A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver. You are now Undead, though you still benefit from healing spells which would normally not affect Undead.

If you are killed, your body reforms within your phylactery 2d10 days after your death unless your phylactery is destroyed. During the next session your character participates in, you have disadvantage on any downtime checks to represent the time spent reforming your body.

Because your phylactery is your soul's primary container, your body is expendable. At any time, you can use an action to cause  your body to self-destruct in an earth-shaking burst of pure Weave energy. At the end of your next turn, you are reduced to 0 hit points and your body is destroyed. This effect cannot be prevented through the Death Ward spell or similar effects. Additionally, all creatures within 30 feet of you when you take this action in this way must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 20d6 force damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage and is not stunned. When you fall to 0 hit points in this way, your soul lingers in the area until the end of the session, upon which it returns to your phylactery. It cannot be removed from this state in any way, excepting by entering a reformed body after using your phylactery. While in this state, you you suffer the following effects:

- You are unable to cast spells of 6th level or higher.
- You are vulnerable to all damage.
- You are invisible.
- You can move through solid objects. If you end your turn within a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage.
- Your only form of movement is a fly speed of 30 feet.
- All magic items you had equipped and/or attuned prior to using this feature are still equipped and/or attuned while in this state.

### Undead Resilience					
At 22nd level, your undead form is refined, removing the weaknesses mortals have. You do not need to breathe and you do not require food, drink, or sleep. You become resistant to cold, necrotic, and lightning damage, and immune to poison damage and the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.

Additionally, if you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw, the DC of which is equal to 5 + the amount of damage taken. If you succeed on this saving throw, you drop to 1 hit point instead of 0. Additionally, you cannot die due to taking massive damage.

### Unholy Ability Score Improvement					
At 23rd level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. These ASI options can increase a score over 20.
Alternatively, you can take a feat.	

### Unholy Boon					
At 24nd level, choose either Orcus or Vecna as your patron. Choose a [boon](boons.md) that your patron grants you. 

A Lich has access to the [Boon of High Magic](boons.md#boon-of-high-magic--special).

You also gain advantage on saving throws against any effects that turn undead as well as on Charisma ability checks you make while interacting with undead creatures.
				
### Paralyzing Arcana
At 25th level, the energy of the dead within you begins to strongly affect your magic. When you cast a spell, all creatures which either fail a saving throw against the spell or are hit by an attack roll from the spell must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature is paralyzed until the end of its next turn and takes 4d6 necrotic damage. You can use this ability once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
