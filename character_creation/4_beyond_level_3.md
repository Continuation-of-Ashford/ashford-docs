# Beyond Level 3
Once you've been playing your character for a while, you may find that you're itching for another character or wanting to tweak your character build. We have rules for that!

## Character Slots

* You can make an additional character when the highest in your roster hits ***`6`, `9` and `12` level***. 
* After ***`12`th level*** you can make an unlimited number of characters who all start as described in the character creation rules.
* You cannot trade or sell items or gold between your own characters in any way ever.

## Reworking

When a character reaches ***`10`th, `15`th, and `20`th level***, it gets a token. These tokens do not have to be spent immediately and can accrue.

You can spend one (`1`) token to change a character's class levels, ability scores, proficiencies, feats, as appropriate. 
You cannot change a character's race, background or inventory.

Each token is specific to the character that earned it via leveling. For example, if you create a new character to replace a retired one, they only get a token if they reach the appropriate level naturally. I.e., if you replace a 13 level character, they have no tokens. If that character levels up to 15th level, they will have 1 token.

## Retiring & Death

When a character dies, or when you feel their days of adventuring have ended, that character is (permanently) retired.

You can no longer play a retired character during sessions, and nothing on their character sheet may be changed. (a retired/dead character's items and gold can't leave their inventory)

You can re-use the character slot for a retired character. When you create a new character in that slot, you may choose to create a new character of the same level as the character that was retired, with the minimum XP for that level.

When replacing a retired character, the new character must clearly be a different character and cannot share the name or appearance of the retired character.

## Un-retiring

If you have a willingly retired character (meaning, not dead), and active character of the same level, you may swap the 2. Un-retiring one and retiring the other.
