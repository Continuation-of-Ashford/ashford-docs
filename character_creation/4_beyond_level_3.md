# Beyond Level 3
Once you've been playing your character for a while, you may find that you're itching for another character or wanting to tweak your character build. We have rules for that!

## Character Slots

* You can make an additional character when the highest in your roster hits ***`6`, `9` and `12` level***. 
* After ***`12`th level*** you can make an unlimited number of characters who all start as described in the character creation rules.
* You cannot trade or sell items or gold between your own characters in any way ever.

## Reworking

When a character reaches ***`10`th, `15`th, and `20`th level***, it gets a token. These tokens do not have to be spent immediately and can accrue.

You can spend one (`1`) token to change a character's class levels, ability scores, proficiencies, feats, as appropriate. 
You cannot change a character's race, background or inventory.

Each token is specific to the character that earned it via leveling. For example, if you create a new character to replace a retired one, they only get a token if they reach the appropriate level naturally. I.e., if you replace a 13 level character, they have no tokens. If that character levels up to 15th level, they will have 1 token.

## Retiring & Death

When a character dies, or when you feel their days of adventuring have ended, that character is (permanently) retired.

You can no longer play a retired character during sessions, and nothing on their character sheet may be changed. (a retired/dead character's items and gold can't leave their inventory)

You can re-use the character slot for a retired character. When you create a new character in that slot, you may choose to create a new character of the same level as the character that was retired, with the minimum XP for that level. New characters that replace old characters start with magic items according to the following:
* 5th level: 2 Uncommon Items
* 10th level: 2 Uncommon Items and 1 Rare Item
* 15th level: 2 Uncommon Items and 2 Rare Items
* 20th level: 2 Uncommon Items, 2 Rare Items, and 1 Very Rare Item

When replacing a retired character, the new character must clearly be a different character and cannot share the name or appearance of the retired character.

## Un-retiring

If you have a willingly retired character (meaning, not dead), and active character of the same level, you may swap the two, un-retiring one and retiring the other.
