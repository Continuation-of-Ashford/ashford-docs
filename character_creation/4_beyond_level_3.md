# Beyond Level 3
Once you've been playing your character for a while, you may find that you're itching for another character or wanting to tweak your character build. We have rules for that!

## Character Slots

* You can make an additional character when the highest in your roster hits ***`6`, `9` and `12` level***. 
* After ***`12`th level*** you can make an unlimited number of characters who all start as described in the character creation rules.
* You cannot trade or sell items or gold between your own characters in any way ever.

## Reworking

When a character reaches ***`10`th, `15`th, and `20`th level***, it gets a token. These tokens do not have to be spent immediately and can accrue.

You can spend one (`1`) token to change a character's class levels, ability scores, proficiencies, feats, and prestige options as appropriate. (`TODO`: explain more the extent of changes that can be made.)

You cannot change a character's race, background or inventory.

Each token is specific to the character that earned it via leveling. For example, if you create a new character to replace a retired one, they only get a token if they reach the appropriate level naturally. I.e., if you replace a 13 level character, they have no tokens. If that character levels up to 15th level, they will have 1 token.
