## Barbarian

### Berserker

The level 3 "Frenzy" feature is replaced with the following feature.

> **Frenzy**
> 
> Whenever you Rage you can choose to also Frenzy. While in a Frenzied Rage you gain a Brutal Critical die that stacks with the number of dice granted by the Brutal Critical feature you gain at 9th level.
>
> Entering a frenzied rage allows you to use the Reckless Frenzy and Unceasing Battle features.
> 
> **Reckless Frenzy**
>
> Once per round during a frenzied rage, if you make a Reckless Attack and hit, you can deal extra damage using your Brutal Critical dice, even when the attack is not a critical hit.
>
> When you use Reckless Frenzy during a frenzied rage you suffer 1 level exhaustion when that rage ends. (Using the feature multiple times during the same rage does not increase how many levels of exhaustion you suffer)
> 
> 
> **Unceasing Battle**
> 
> When your frenzied rage ends, you can try to delay the levels of exhaustion gained from the Reckless Frenzy feature until the end of your next frenzied rage. To do so you must succeed at a Constitution saving throw. The DC is `10 +5 for every level of exhaustion you are already delaying`.
>
> On a success you delay any exhaustion due to Reckless Frenzy until the end of your next frenzied rage. Keep track of how many levels of exhaustion you are delaying.
>
> On a failure, you don't delay the exhaustion, suffering all the levels of exhaustion you've been delaying, plus any exhaustion caused by the rage that ended. You then reset the levels of exhaustion you are delaying to 0.
> 
> When you finish a long rest, you also reset the levels of exhaustion you are delaying to 0.  

| For example: |
|:-------------|
|Trogdor rages and chooses to Frenzy. Trogdor then uses Reckless Frenzy during the first and third turn of their rage. When that rage ends, trogdor succeeds his DC 10 CON saving throw. He is now delaying 1 level of exhaustion.<br/>Trogdor rages again afterwards, but chooses not to frenzy, there is no risk of gaining exhaustion when their normal rage ends, because it is not a frenzied rage.<br/>Trogdor then enters a 3rd rage and chooses for it to be a frenzied rage, and uses Reckless Frenzy again; He is still delaying 1 level of exhaustion, so his save DC is `10+5`. Trogdor fails his saving throw and suffers 2 levels of exhaustion.<br/>Trogdor is now no longer delaying any exhaustion, so if he frenzies a 4th time and uses Reckless Frenzy, the DC will be 10 again.|

Also, the Intimidating Presence feature has an amendment to the third sentence:
> "...If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier (if positive, minimum of 0) + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn."

## Bard

### Creation
The first sentence of the 6th level **Animating performance** feature now reads:
> "As an action, you can animate one Large or smaller non-magical inanimate object within 30 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried."

## Cleric

### Peace
Emboldening Bond has an amendment to its duration:
>  "You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes, until you use this feature again, **or any bonded creature is reduced to 0 hit points.** "

## Fighter 

### Arcane Archer

Arcane Shot has a number of uses equal to `2 + your proficiency bonus`.

### Echo Knight

For the purposes of (creature) type, the echo is an object. (but is not inanimate)


## Monk

### Perfect Self
The existing ability has been replaced with the following:

> For one turn, all ki point costs are halved to a minimum of 1. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
> 
> In addition, when you hit an attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can add your wisdom modifier to the damage roll.

## Ranger
Ranger's Favored Foe and Foe Slayer have been rewritten with the following features:

> ### Favored Foe
> 
> 1st-level ranger optional feature, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature
> 
> You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the Hunter's Mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a number of times without expending a spell slot equal to your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1). Once you reach 6th levels in ranger, you do not require concentration on Hunter's Mark. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
> 
> In addition, when you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, Hunter's Mark does not count against the number of ranger spells you know.

> ### Foe Slayer
> 
> At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll **and** the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied."

## Rogue

### Steady Aim

The optional feature Steady Aim requires you to not move at all during your turn, which includes being on a mount or flying item.
