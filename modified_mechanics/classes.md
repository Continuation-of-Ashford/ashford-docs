## Barbarian

### Berserker

The level 3 "Frenzy" feature is replaced with the following. It amends one existing feature and adds two new ones.

> **Frenzy**
> 
> When you Rage you can choose to Frenzy. While in a Frenzy you gain a Brutal Critical die, this stacks with the number of dice granted by the Brutal Critical feature you gain at 9th level.
> 
> **Reckless Frenzy**
> 
>> Once per round, if you make a Reckless Attack during a Frenzy and hit, you can deal extra damage using your Brutal Critical dice, even when the attack is not a critical hit. When you use this feature you suffer a level exhaustion at the end of your rage.
> 
> **Intimidating Presence**
> 
>> Has an amendment to the third sentence: "...If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier (if positive, minimum of 0) + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn."
> 
> **Unceasing Battle**
> 
>> When your rage ends, making a Constitution saving throw. The DC is equal to 10 + 5 times the number of the Frenzy feature used since your last long rest. On a pass you can suppress the levels of exhaustion gained from the Frenzy feature until the end of your next rage. This DC resets on a long rest.

## Ranger
(`TODO`: Clarify this section. Existing documentation is not clear.)

### Ranger: Favored Foe

1st-level ranger optional feature, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature

You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the Hunter's Mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a number of times without expending a spell slot equal to your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1). Once you reach 6th levels in ranger, you do not require concentration on Hunter's Mark. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, when you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, Hunter's Mark does not count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Ranger: Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll **and** the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied."

## Fighter 

### Arcane Archer

Arcane Shot has a number of uses equal to 2 + proficency bonus.

### Echo Knight

For the purposes of (creature) type, the echo is an object.

## Cleric 

### Twilight

Eyes of Night has its Darkvision restored to infinite and the wording is as follows: "Your eyes are blessed, allowing you to see through the deepest gloom. You have darkvision with no maximum range; you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

## Monk

### Perfect Self
The existing ability has been replaced with the following:

> For one turn, all ki point costs are halved to a minimum of 1. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. In addition, when you hit an attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can add your wisdom modifier to the damage roll.

## Rogue

### Steady Aim

The optional feature Steady Aim requires you to not move at all during your turn, which includes being on a mount or flying item.
