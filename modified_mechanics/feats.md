# Feats

## Brawny
> Should a Small creature gain the feat Brawny (UA: Feats for Skills, pg. 1), they may ignore the Heavy property of any weapon within reason. (i.e. greatsword, greataxe, etc.)

## Lucky
> If a creature has the Lucky feat (PHB, pg. 167) or any other source of luck points, it may only use one luck point per turn.

## Dual Wielder
Now reads as the following:
> * You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren't light.
> * You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
> * You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
> * If you use two-weapon fighting, it does not cost your bonus action.  You cannot use two-weapon fighting more than once per round.

## Defensive Duelist
Now reads as the following:
> When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC until the end of the current turn, potentially causing the attack to miss.

## Mounted Combatant
Now has an additional clause:
> You can form a mystical connection to one creature you use as a mount.  If the mount is slain in combat, you can spend an extended rest to resurrect the creature. This functions the same as resurrection, but does not require costly magical components.
