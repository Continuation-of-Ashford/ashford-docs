# Feats

## Brawny
Should a Small creature gain the feat Brawny (UA: Feats for Skills, pg. 1), they may ignore the Heavy property of any weapon within reason. (i.e. greatsword, greataxe, etc.)

## Lucky
If a creature has the Lucky feat (PHB, pg. 167) or any other source of luck points, it may only use one luck point per turn.

## Dual Wielder
The Dual Wielder (PHB pg. 165) text is replaced with the following:

> You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
> 
> Before you take the Attack action while wielding two light melee weapons, you can choose to make all attacks that turn at a -5 penalty. If you choose to do so, you can make 1 additional attack with the weapon in your other hand; and any feature that lets you make  additional attacks, such as Extra Attack, Dread Ambusher and Thirsting Blade, allows you to make these additional attacks a 2nd time, but you must use each of the weapons you are holding for an equal number of attacks.

(i.e. an 11th level fighter holding a handaxe and a shortsword can use their attack action to make 3 attacks normally or 6 attacks at a -5 penalty. If they make 6 attacks, they must make 3 of those with the handaxe and 3 of those with the shortsword)
