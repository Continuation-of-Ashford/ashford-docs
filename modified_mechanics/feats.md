# Feats

## Brawny
Should a Small creature gain the feat Brawny (UA: Feats for Skills, pg. 1), they may ignore the Heavy property of any weapon within reason. (i.e. greatsword, greataxe, etc.)

## Lucky
If a creature has the Lucky feat (PHB, pg. 167) or any other source of luck points, it may only use one luck point per turn.

## Dual Wielder
The Dual Wielder (PHB pg. 165) text is replaced with the following:
> * You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren't light.
> * You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
> * You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
> * Before you take the Attack Action while wielding two one-handed melee weapons, you can choose to make all attack rolls within that action at a -5 penalty. If you choose to do so, you can make 1 additional attack with the weapon in your other hand; and any feature that lets you make additional attacks (such as Extra Attack, Dread Ambusher and Thirsting Blade) allows you to make these additional attacks a 2nd time, but you must use each of the weapons you are holding for an equal number of attacks during your attack action.

(i.e. an 11th level fighter holding a handaxe and a shortsword can use their attack action to make 3 attacks normally or 6 attacks at a -5 penalty. If they make 6 attacks, they must make 3 of those with the handaxe and 3 of those with the shortsword. This uses their action, the fighter can still use a bonus action afterwards for the Two-weapon Fighting Bonus Action because they meet the requirements. They could even use Action Surge to take another Attack Action, and again choose between 3 attacks or 6 attacks at a -5 penalty.)
