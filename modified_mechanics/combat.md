# Combat Rule Changes

## Spellcasting Economy

* Casting a spell using a bonus action does not prevent you from casting other spells that require a spell slot on your turn.
  
For example: You can cast Fireball (Action) and Shadow Blade (Bonus Action) on the same turn, then counterspell an enemy attempting to counterspell your fireball.

## Mounted Combat

* In order to mount a creature, that creature must be willing.
