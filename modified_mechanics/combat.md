# Combat Rule Changes

## Spellcasting Economy

* Casting a spell using a bonus action does not prevent you from casting other spells that require a spell slot on your turn.
  
For example: You can cast Fireball (Action) and Shadow Blade (Bonus Action) on the same turn, then counterspell an enemy attempting to counterspell your fireball.

# Rule Clarifications and Reminders

## Combat Movement

* Opportunity attacks can only be taken against targets you can see.
* If a creature is moved **without** using its own movement it does not provoke an opportunity attack (i.e. a creature pushed by the Repelling Blast Eldritch Invocation, the Open Hand Monk Flurry of Blows or one held/grappled by a creature). If it uses its own movement **even against its will** it does provoke an opportunity attack (Command, Turn Undead, Dissonant Whispers, etc).
* Items 'of flying' (broom, carpet, etc) have their own speed instead of giving you a speed, therefore its movement is completely independent from your own and it has no action so cannot dash. 
* Chariots and other animal-drawn vehicles would differ as they are dependent on the speed of a creature which does have action economy.

## Area of Effect (AOE) & Cover

If an area of effect covers at least half a square, it affects that square.

To determine whether a target has cover against an attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the attacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including another creature) the target has half cover. If three or four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit) the target has three-quarters cover.

## Grapple

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.

Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Moving a Grappled Target**

When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

**Examples of features, feats or traits that do not allow grapple are:**

* Barbarian Berserker feature Retaliation: "Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature."
* Monk Astral Self feature Arms of the Astral Self: "You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes."
* Polearm Master: "When you take the Attack action and attack with only a glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon;"

**Examples of features or traits that *do* allow grapple are:**

* Simic Hybrid race trait Grappling Appendage: "As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature."
* Loxodon race trait Trunk: "You can grasp things with your trunk...grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike."

## Melee or Ranged Attacks with Melee or Ranged weapons

Page 146 in the Player's Handbook has the weapons table. That table is separated into the categories Simple Melee Weapons, Simple Ranged Weapons, Martial Melee Weapons, and Martial Ranged Weapons.

Weapons originating from other sources, such as the weapon summoned by the Shadow Blade spell, or the Psychic Blades summoned by the Soulknife rogue subclass, or the firearms listed on page 267 of the Dungeon Master's Guide usually mention which of those 4 categories they fall into.

Each weapon belongs to at most 1 category.  
Using a weapon incorrectly: i.e. making a melee attack using a weapon from the ranged category, will turn the weapon into an improvised weapon for that attack.

If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. *However that does not mean the weapon is now part of the ranged weapon category.*


When the Rogue feature Sneak Attack reads `"The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon."` throwing a javelin does not qualify, because that is a ranged attack using a melee weapon that lacks the finesse property.

The archery fighting style gives a `"+2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons"` that phrasing specifically refers to the simple/martial ranged weapon categories, and not *"all ranged weapon attacks"*.

A melee weapon or a vial of holy water, does not belong to the ranged weapon category. Thus any feat or feature that specifically requires a `"ranged weapon"` will not work with most thrown weapons, but does work with the Dart and Net weapons, because those are thrown weapons in the ranged category.

Weapons that lack a category, such as the natural weapons used by beasts a druid can Wildshape into, will not benefit from any feature or feat that specifically requires a `melee weapon` or a `ranged weapon` to be used for the attack. But would benefit from effects that require a `melee weapon attack` because natural weapons are still weapons, they just lack a specific category.
