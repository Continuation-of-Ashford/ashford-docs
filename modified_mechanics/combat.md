# In-Combat Rules and Reminders

## Spellcasting Economy

* Casting a spell using a bonus action does not prevent you from casting other spells that require a spell slot on your turn.
  
For example: You can cast Fireball (Action) and Shadow Blade (Bonus Action) on the same turn, then counterspell an enemy attempting to counterspell your fireball.

## Combat Movement

* Opportunity attacks can only be taken against targets you can see.
* If a creature is moved **without** using its own movement it does not provoke an opportunity attack (i.e. a creature pushed by the Repelling Blast Eldritch Invocation, the Open Hand Monk Flurry of Blows or one held/grappled by a creature). If it uses its own movement **even against its will** it does provoke an opportunity attack (Command, Turn Undead, Dissonant Whispers, etc).
* Items 'of flying' (broom, carpet, etc) have their own speed instead of giving you a speed, therefore its movement is completely independent from your own and it has no action so cannot dash. 
* Chariots and other animal-drawn vehicles would differ as they are dependent on the speed of a creature which does have action economy.

## Area of Effect (AOE) & Cover

If an area of effect covers at least half a square, it affects that square.

To determine whether a target has cover against an attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the attacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including another creature) the target has half cover. If three or four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit) the target has three-quarters cover.

## Grapple

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.

Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Moving a Grappled Target**

When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

**Examples of features, feats or traits that do not allow grapple are:**

* Barbarian Berserker feature Retaliation: "Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature."
* Monk Astral Self feature Arms of the Astral Self: "You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes."
* Polearm Master: "When you take the Attack action and attack with only a glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon;"

**Examples of features or traits that *do* allow grapple are:**

* Simic Hybrid race trait Grappling Appendage: "As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature."
* Loxodon race trait Trunk: "You can grasp things with your trunk...grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike."
