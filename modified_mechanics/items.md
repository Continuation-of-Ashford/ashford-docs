## Tomes and Manuals

If a character uses one of the manuals, tomes or a similar item, the cooldown extends to all future copies in addition to the item used for that character i.e. If a character uses a Manual of Gainful Exercise or Tome of Leadership and Influence, the time in which it takes to use that manual again extends to any of that item found in the future.

# Attunements

## Attunement Limits
The maximum number of attunement slots is increased by 2 to 5.

*`Tip:` If you don't know, an attunement slot is the equivalent of an "equipment slot" employed by many video games. In D&D 5e, these slots are only used for magic items, but only for some of them. Look for the `(requires attunement)` property underneath the item name*.

## Magic tattoos
`TODO:` Rewrite this.

Magic tattoos have an amendment to their Tattoo Attunement feature:

> If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. You are still subject to the space requirements of the Magic Tattoo Coverage table (TCE pg. 118).

## Summoned Creatures

Creatures summoned through spells, acquired in sessions, created, or otherwise obtained through class features with an INT of `4` or less may equip/attune to `3` magic items at maximum or `4` magic items with an INT of 6.

Creatures with an INT of `10` or above may attune/equip to items as shown in [Character Creation](character_creation.md). A creature must have the proper anatomy to attune to/equip a magic item, such as creatures with hooves or bird-like talons cannot wear shoes. You cannot give a creature acquired in these ways a piercing, have them ingest, or otherwise rest on or in the item some way to circumvent this. 

Creatures found these ways may not artificially increase a stat to gain additional attunement slots, such as a Headband of Intellect, nor have them attune to the item they were summoned from such as a Shield Guardian attuning to a Shield Guardian amulet, ad nauseam. Player characters are exempt from this ruling unless their Intelligence score is `6` or lower
