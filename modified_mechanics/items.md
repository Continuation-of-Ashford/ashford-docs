# Item Changes

## Spell save DC Increasing items

If you attune to multiple items that increase your class' spell save DC, that effect does not stack. Legendary items (i.e. the Robe of the Archmagi) do stack.

## Bag of Beans

Each character can only gain the benefits of eating two eggs from the Bag of Beans.

## Tomes and Manuals

Reading a Tome of X or Manual of X requires a downtime. Two tomes or manuals may be read in one downtime. If a character uses one of the manuals, tomes or a similar stat-boosting item, the cooldown extends to all future copies of the item used for that character. I.E., If a character uses a Manual of Gainful Exercise, they would not be able to benefit from another Manual of Gainful Excercise for a century. They could still read a Tome of Leadership and Influence their next downtime.

## Magical Armor (Generic variant)

Generic magical armor has had its rarity reduced by 1 step as following:
* +1 armor: uncommon, wondrous
* +2 armor: rare, wondrous
* +3 armor: very rare, wondrous

## Amulet of the Devout

Amulet of the Devout only increases the spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs of your cleric or paladin spells.

## Shield Guardian Amulet

The Shield Guardian has its rarity increased to very rare. Crafting a Shield Guardian Amulet also creates a shield guardian bound to the amulet.

## Guns: Bad News and Hand Mortar

Gunslinger Fighters can craft the Bad News and Hand Mortar as if they were Uncommon items.

## Mizzium Aparatus

The Mizzium Aparatus now reads as the following:

**Mizzium Apparatus** 

_Very rare, wondrous.  Requires attunement by a wizard, warlock, or sorcerer._ 

Mizzium Apparatuses can be one of three types:  wizard aparatus, warlock aparatus, or sorcerer aparatus.  The type of apparatus is determined at the time of its creation and cannot be changed.  It can only be attuned to by a character of the class associated with the apparatus.

While you are wearing the Mizzium Apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus. In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared. The spell you choose must be on the spell list associated with the Apparatus, of a spell level for which you would normally be able to cast of that class's spell list, and you must provide the spell's components. (I.E. Joe Blow is a Cleric 6/Wizard 3 with a Wizard Mizzium Aparatus.  He can cast his prepared cleric and wizard spells, or use the aparatus to cast any 1st or 2nd level wizard spell using his Aparatus. Jon Schmoe is a sorcerer 11 with a Sorcerer Mizzium Aparatus.  He can cast his known sorcerer spells normally, or any 1st-6th level sorcerer spell using his aparatus.)

You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC is 13 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.

On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.

If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence (Arcana) check is 13, and on a failed check, there is no effect.


## Potions
Commonly used potions have standard prices, as follows:

| Type                        | Cost    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Potion of Healing           | 50gp    |
| Potion of Greater Healing   | 150gp   |
| Potion of Superior Healing  | 450gp   |
| Potion of Supreme Healing   | 1500gp  |
| Potion of X Resistance      | 1000gp  |

# Attunements

## Attunement Limits
The maximum number of attunement slots is increased by 2 to 5.

*`Tip:` If you don't know, an attunement slot is the equivalent of an "equipment slot" employed by many video games. In D&D 5e, these slots are only used for magic items, but only for some of them. Look for the `(requires attunement)` property underneath the item name*.

## Magic tattoos

Magic tattoos have an amendment to their Tattoo Attunement feature:

> If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. You are still subject to the space requirements of the Magic Tattoo Coverage table (TCE pg. 118).

## Summoned Creatures

Creatures summoned through spells or items, acquired in sessions, created, or otherwise obtained through class features with an INT of `4` or less may equip/attune to `3` magic items at maximum. Creatures with an INT of six may attune to `4` magic items.

Creatures with an INT of `10` or above may attune/equip to items as shown in [Character Creation](character_creation.md). A creature must have the proper anatomy to attune to/equip a magic item, such as creatures with hooves or bird-like talons cannot wear shoes. You cannot give a creature acquired in these ways a piercing, have them ingest, or otherwise rest on or in the item some way to circumvent this. 

Creatures found these ways may not artificially increase a stat to gain additional attunement slots, such as a Headband of Intellect, nor attune to the another item that summons a creature such as a Shield Guardian attuning to a Shield Guardian amulet, ad nauseam.
