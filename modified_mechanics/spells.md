# Spells

## Chronurgy and Graviturgy Wizard Spells

The spells added by Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (EGW) to the Chronurgy and Graviturgy wizard subclasses are now standard in the Wizard spells table.

## Teleportation Circle

Teleportation Circle is now a ritual spell.

## Psionic Disciplines

Usage of Psionic Disciplines from the Mystic Class are considered spellcasting for the purposes of the barbarian rage feature.

## Skywrite

The Skywrite spell (XGE pg. 165) now reads as the following (**bolded changes**):

> You cause up to ten words to form in a part of the sky you can see. The words appear to be made of cloud and remain in place for the spell's duration. The words dissipate when the spell ends. **A strong wind can disperse the clouds but if you are still concentrating for the duration you may reform the words.**

## Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (PHB pg. 264) now reads as the following (**bolded changes**):

> A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.
> 
> **Nothing - not physical objects, energy, spell effects or spell-like effects - can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there.** The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.
> 
> The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.
> 
> A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

## True Polymorph
True Polymorph has the following additions:
> You cannot polymorph a creature or object into a named creature that has its own stat block/sheet separate from a generic version of its race/type."

## Clone
Clone (PHB pg. 222) now reads as the following (**bolded changes**):

> **This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living Small or Medium creature as a safeguard against death.** This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.
> 
> At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

## Simulacrum
A Simulacrum cannot cast the Wish or Simulacrum spells.
