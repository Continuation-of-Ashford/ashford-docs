# Spells and Psionics

## Psionic Disciplines

Usage of Psionic Disciplines from the Mystic Class are considered spellcasting for the purposes of the barbarian rage feature.  Any effect that would prevent spells from succeeding or affecting something also affects psionics.

## True Polymorph
True Polymorph has the following additions:
> If you polymorph a creature or object into a named creature, it gains the appearance and racial abilities of that creature, but none of the named creature's unique abilities.  If you want to polymorph into another player's character, you cannot do so without the player's express consent.
> You cannot transform into a creature whose CR exceeds 20.

## Simulacrum
A Simulacrum cannot cast the Wish or Simulacrum spells.

## Blinding Smite
Blinding Smite has been added to the Hexblade Warlock's expanded spell list.
