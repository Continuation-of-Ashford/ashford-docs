# Below you will find the various options you have when using your downtime.
## Copying a spell
You may spend up to two (2) hours per day copying spells into your spellbook without consuming a downtime, up to a maximum of 14 hours per downtime. If your character needs less than 8 hours of sleep, such as a character with Sentry\'s Rest, Trance or Undying Nature, you may add those hours to copying spells for 4 hours and 6 hours respectively, up to 32 hours or 42 hours. You must still find these spells, such as through a session, PC or spell scroll. Spells copied in this way should have written at the bottom of their own descriptions who they were copied by.
## Crafting a magic item
You spend a week investing funds and attention into enchanting a magical item, doing so requires either proficiency in the Arcana skill or a relevant tool. Using the table below, buying materials for the item will cost half of the rolled price and items rare or higher require specific relevant components as well. If the item is an enchanted version of a nonmagical item that must also be provided. You cannot create Legendary items. After rolling a price you have the option to not proceed with the crafting, but the downtime is spent.
* Common items or 2 consumable common items can be completed in one week without a skill check.

#### Rarity | Price Formula
	* Common | (1d8+2) * 10
	* Uncommon | (1d10+2) * 50
	* Rare | (2d10+2) * 250
	* Very Rare | (2d10+2) * 2500

**Adamantine items such as armor, ammunition and weapons cost base price in addition to 1000 gp.
Wondrous items cost an additional 1.5 * rolled price.
Scrolls cost an additional 1d10 * 10% + rolled price.**

Taking the original price, divide it by 25 for uncommon, 50 for rare or 200 for very rare. Keep track of this number. Each downtime used, you make a skill check using Arcana or a relevant tool and subtract it from the above, carrying this new number forward if it is not 0. When the number reaches 0 the item is complete.
## Crafting a Mundane Item
You spend a week crafting items of the common populace. An item needs raw materials to be crafted, equal in gold or a lower denomination if applicable, to half its listed price. To craft the item, take its price and divide it by 50. This is the total amount your character must meet per relevant tool check, per downtime. A character can sell an item crafted in this way to NPCs for its original listed price.

In addition, you may silver a non-magical weapon or ten pieces of non-magical ammunition for an additional 150 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.
## Education
You receive education at the Aurelian Collegiate for a language or tool to gain proficiency. This typically takes 10 weeks, but this time is reduced by a number of weeks equal to your character\'s Intelligence modifier if positive at a minimum of 1 week. Education in these classes requires a fee of 25gp per week.
## Gambling
You spend a week mingling with those who find thrill or opportunity in games of chance, reading your opponents in tests of luck and skill. A character doing the gambling downtime puts forward a wager of their desired gold amount three checks: Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception), and Charisma (Intimidation) or (Persuasion). If the character has proficiency with a gaming set, one of the checks can be replaced with one using that tool. You can additionally roll a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) which adds a +5 to the DC at levels 3 to 10 and a +10 at levels 11 to 20.

The DCs are as follows per level bracket, rolled for each check independently by the DM:

	* Levels 3 to 7: DC 2d10+5
	* Levels 8 to 16: DC 2d10+10
	* Levels 17 to 20: DC 2d10+15

At 0 successes you lose your wager and gain an equal debt to the casino; at 1 success you lose half your wager; at 2 successes gain 1.5x times your wager; at 3 successes you win twice your wager. If you fail your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) all successive rolls are automatic fails. It is up to the casino to allow you entry again should you get caught.
## Pit Fighting
You spend a week fighting in Stratton Bayâ€™s arena. You make a series of three checks: (Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics) and a Constitution saving throw, with the option to substitute one with an attack roll using a weapon. The DC is determined by the quality of your opposition, easy, challenging or deadly). You earn gold depending on the number of successes achieved.

	* Easy: DC 2d10+5 | 3d10 / 6d10 / 10d10 gp
	* Challenging: DC 2d10+10 | 15d10 / 30d10 / 50d10 gp
	* Deadly: DC 2d10+15 | 30d10 / 60d10 / 100d10 g

## Work
You spend a week using your skills amongst the working class. Roll a skill or tool and multiply it by your level.
* For example, rolling a 16 Charisma (Persuasion) at level 12 gives 192 gold.

## Help
You spend a week aiding an ally in their endeavors by forfeiting your time and splitting any gold costs, not rewards. You give one ally advantage on all checks they make in their downtime activity excluding pit fighting.

## Scribing a spell scroll
You spend a downtime(s) scribing a scroll, or contributing a spell scroll. Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell you want to scribe, as shown below. In addition you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or Calligraphy tools, provide any material components needed for the casting of the spell, and have the spell prepared - if possible - or among your known spells. If these numbers can be halved in any way such as a class feature, the result is rounded up.

#### Spell Level | Time, Cost
	* Cantrip | 3 per week, 25gp
	* 1st | 2 per week, 50gp
	* 2nd | 2 per week, 250gp
	* 3rd | 1 week, 500gp
	* 4th | 1 week, 1,000gp
	* 5th | 2 weeks, 2,500gp
	* 6th | 2 weeks, 5,000gp
	* 7th | 3 weeks, 15,000gp
	* 8th | 4 weeks, 25,000gp
	* 9th | 5 weeks, 100,000gp

## Training Hall
If you are within 600 xp of the next level, you can spend the downtime training to reach the next level at minimum experience.

**At 20th level:**
If you have abilities that can be swapped upon leveling up or gaining an ASI (i.e. fighting styles, eldritch invocations, sorcerer spells) you can change them using this downtime.
## Taming

Players can spend downtime capturing and taming creatures to be their mount. For normal mounts they can be bought as shown in the item table.

* You must have a stronghold that can accommodate your mount while you tame it.
* Creatures of 8 intelligence or higher cannot be tamed and named/titled/homebrew creatures are disallowed.
* This takes 1 downtime per CR of the creature being tamed, each downtime requires an animal handling check of 10 + CR + Creature INT mod.
* The DM rules which creatures can be trained. Both with regards to having the appropriate anatomy to be comfortably mounted, and with regards whether this creature has instincts that cannot be suppressed. (Things that consume souls for example, like the Hellfire Engine.)

## Scrapping a magic item
Occasionally, the party may find a magic item they can find no use or buyers for.  In this case, it is prudent to extract its core components to recycle them into a more useful items.  "Melting down" an item in such a way requires 3 downtimes for a rare item or 6 downtimes for a very rare item.  Items yield components of an equal rarity.

## Hiring an NPC crafter
Sometimes a character lacks the talent (or the patience) to craft an item by themselves.  In these cases, they may use their downtime to contract others to construct the item for them.  Hiring more competent crafters costs more money.  This functions the same as the **Crafting a Magic Item** downtime, except you substitute the artisan\'s roll for your own.  The quality of artisans available depends on your level bracket.

	* 3 - 7 | Novice - Check: 1d20+1 and pay additional 25% of rolled crafting price
	* 8 - 12 | Apprentice - Check: 1d20+5 and pay additional 40% of rolled crafting price
	* 13 - 16 | Journeyman - Check: 1d20+10 and pay additional 60% of rolled crafting price
	* 17 - 20 | Master - Check: 1d20+20 and pay additional 80% of rolled crafting price
