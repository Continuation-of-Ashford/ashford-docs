# Welcome to The Recolonization of Ashford!
You feel the energy of the portal that enveloped you close. You have taken the first step in starting your own adventure away from your previous life and found your way here at last. The last thing you remember is a bright flash of light, the portal enveloping you and whisking you away to a foreign land ripe with new opportunities. 
You awake in the center of what seems to be a small hamlet- the cool salty air washes over your face, and the warm sun beats down on you from above as your eyes slowly focus more and more.
Beneath you the ground is cold and hard- once you stand you notice it to be a large round disk of obsidian- carved into which are unrecognizable symbols.
You look about the hamlet now and notice the primarily human population with occasional odd races scattered throughout. These others seem clad in various garbs, armor and the likes- indicating to you that they are adventurers. 
While you stand there bewildered- a man approaches and introduces himself. "Welcome to Kasr adventurer- the Kass has seen fit to produce another champion for us."

# Getting Started
Welcome to ReCoA! We're happy you've decided to join. 

ReCoA is a "Westmarches" server. So at any given time, multiple DMs and many players will be engaging with the world and its inhabitants in game sessions or text-based roleplay. This form of play is a bit different than your standard single-party and DM games, and so we follow a slightly modified set of rules and gameplay to keep things fun, engaging, and balanced. 

The guides below should help bring you up to speed on what exactly we do different. If you're new to D&D 5e, some of these resources may even help you get started up even faster. 

*But be careful to not bring our rules into any other games you might be playing!* :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Sheets and VTT
The first thing you'll need to do after reading the rules is get access to our Foundry server and decide on where you want to pull your character sheet information from. 

See our [Guide to Sheets and VTT](sheets/sheets_vtt.md) to learn more.
## Character Creation
Now that you've got access and picked your sheet source, head on over to the [Character Creation Guide](character_creation/0_creation_guide.md) to get started! The guide outlines the customizations that ReCoA has implemented for Player Character options.

If you've never made a character in D&D 5e before, follow along in the ["Step-by-Step Characters"](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,0,step-by-step%20characters) section of the Player's Handbook (pg. 11) as you go through each section and make your choices. 

# Modified Rules 
ReCoA employs a number of customized rules that we believe improve the player experience. These rules are linked from relevant locations in the Character Creation Guide.

See our [Custom Rules Guide](modified_mechanics/rules.md) to learn more.

# Playing the Game
With so many DMs, players, characters, and sessions, there are a lot of moving pieces involved. To make things just a little bit easier for our DMs, please take some time to familiarize yourself with our expectations for you as a player in the [Session Flow Guide](playing_the_game/session_flow.md).

Because ReCoA is a Westmarches-style game in a linear timeline, your character will benefit from the time *between* your sessions. At the start of each session, you will be allowed one Downtime Action for the character you are bringing to the session. Take a look at the [Downtime Actions Guide](playing_the_game/downtime_actions.md) to learn more!

We play on FoundryVTT.  The link to our table can be found here: https://ashford-moltenhosting.moltenhosting.com/join

## Settlement
One of the more exciting aspects of our gameplay at ReCoA is the concept of "Settlement". 

Want to build a pig-sty? Kinda weird, but go for it. 

A town hall and tavern? Totally makes sense, someone's gotta serve my ale and collect my taxes.

A *kingdom*?? Now that's what I'm talking about. 

Head over to the [Settlements Guide](playing_the_game/settlements.md) to learn how you can do all of the above and more. 

## Guilds

Want to find like-minded adventurers? Got a despot you want to overthrow? Or maybe your character is just lonely?

Either way, feel free to create a player guild!  Take a look at the [Guild Rules](Guilds/Guild_rules.md) to learn more!
