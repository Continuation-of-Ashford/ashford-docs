# Getting Started
Below you'll find The Continuation of Ashford's custom rules and guidelines to for creating and developing your character. 

## Sheets and VTT

### Foundry VTT
We use [Foundry virtual tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com)! Please ping the `@Big Mans` or `@Dungeon Masters` roles on Discord to be given a login. 

The Foundry server will automatically shut down after a period of inactivity. If you need it to be turned back on, please ping `@Big Mans` or `@Dungeon Masters` on Discord.

(TBD: Add link publicly here?)

### D&D Beyond
You can create your sheet through D&D Beyond and then import that sheet onto Foundry via button in the UI.

(`TODO`: insert image of the button or video of the process.)

# General Character Creation

Anywhere where you see a "filtered list" of options in a picture below, you can recreate that selection on [5e.tools](https://5e.tools), which is an unofficial D&D 5e resource.

* All characters start from level 3 with standard 27-point buy.
* For HP you can roll or take flat values with one hp re-roll per character.
* Starting player items are as described in the Playerâ€™s Handbook and in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything for Artificer (TCE, pg. 9).
* Customizing Your Origin (TCE, pg. 7) is not allowed.

## Notable Changes
* PC stats can go above 20 through either ASIs (Ability Score Improvements) or items.
* The maximum amount of attunement slots is increased to 5.

# Core Character Creation

## Races
To see allowed Races, set the filters according to the image below, or use this [link](https://5e.tools/races.html#flstsource:psz=1~uagothicheroes=1~ttp=1~oga=1~lr=1~awm=1~scc=0,flopsource:extend,sublistselected:%7b%22items%22%3a%5b%5d%2c%22sources%22%3a%5b%5d%7d).

![](assets/allowed_races.png)

* When creating your character, think about if the race selection fits within the general lore of Forgotten Realms in 5e. If your character's race is from a different IP that does not exist in the Forgotten Realms in 5e, it will not be allowed.
* All UA or earlier official content reprinted in future official books must be updated (i.e. Minotaurs, triton and centaurs from VGM to MOT, Dhampir from UA:GL to VRGR). There are no exceptions.

### Caveats
* If you would like to use Custom Lineage (TCE), approval from `@Big Mans` or `@Dungeon Masters` is required.
* If you are allowed to use a Custom Lineage, you can pick one race for the purposes of racially locked feats and items. This must be recorded in your sheet.

We allow items with the Renaissance tag but not the Futuristic tag. There are no exceptions.

# Server Specific

## Nicknames

After creating your character, please change your nickname to show the initial and level and try to keep this updated in one of the following formats.

Single Character:
```
Username (CharacterName lvl)
Username (CharacterInitials lvl)
```
Multiple Characters:
```
Username (CharacterName lvl,CharacterName2 lvl)
Username (CharacterInitials lvl,CharacterInitials2 lvl)
```
For example:
```
@Last_Username (Zhax 5) 
@Firecard (R20,K20,I20,W,D,M,Z)
```

## Character Slots

* You can make an additional character when the highest in your roster hits ***`6`, `9` and `12` level***. 
* After ***`12`th level*** you can make an unlimited number of characters who all start as described in the character creation rules.
* You cannot trade or sell items or gold between your own characters in any way ever.

## Character Background

Once you have created a character, you can optionally put a small background along with a picture in the `#characters` channel on Discord.

## Token Creation

Once you have created your character, you will need to create a token. 

Find your character art and either 
* create a token using [Token Stamp 2](http://rolladvantage.com/tokenstamp/) and pasting a public url (such as imgur) in the token image path of your character's token settings
* or create it directly in the sheet using the "Roll Advantage" icon next to the image path field. (See image below.)

![](assets/token_creation.png)

## Reworking

When a character reaches ***`10`th, `15`th, and `20`th level***, it gets a token. These tokens do not have to be spent immediately and can accrue.

You can spend one (`1`) token to change a character's class levels, ability scores, proficiencies, feats, and prestige options as appropriate. (`TODO`: explain more the extent of changes that can be made.)

You cannot change a character's race, background or inventory.

Each token is specific to the character that earned it via leveling. For example, if you create a new character to replace a retired one, they only get a token if they reach the appropriate level naturally. I.e., if you replace a 13 level character, they have no tokens. If that character levels up to 15th level, they will have 1 token.
