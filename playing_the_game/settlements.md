# Settlements
## Founding an Outpost
Settlements are built around a capital building that brings the community together. Of course, this costs money and your characters will need to spend their time between adventures (downtimes) constructing those buildings. Fortunately, players can pool their money and downtimes together to build faster.

In order to found a settlement, you must first build a Trade Post in terrain (see below) that is different from the nearest settlement to where you want to build one.  Once the trade post has finished construction, you are the owner of that settlement and other buildings can be created there.  You have control over what buildings are made (and destroyed) there.  You must also make a post naming your settlement in the settlements tab in discord, where it will be made into a thread.  That thread will contain all of the buildings and strongholds the settlement possesses.  

The tier of your settlement and its infractructure determines how many buildings with useful effects it can support.

If you wish to build a [stronghold](strongholds.md), it must be supported by a settlement of an appropriate tier. Establishments can be built at Tier 2 (Village), while other can begin being built at Tier 3 (Town)

It is possible that a settlement may reach its building capacity without constructing a building that is required to reach the next tier.  In that case, a settlement owner may abuse their powers of eminent domain and declare a building condemned and mark it for destruction.  To destroy a completed building, a number of downtimes and amount of gold equal to one quarter the building's base cost (minimum 1) must be spent.  If the building does not belong to the settlement's owner(s), the gold is paid to whomever originally paid to construct the building.  If the building being destroyed is not complete, there is no gold cost, and the number of downtimes required to destroy it is equal to a quarter of the number of downtimes spent building it (minimum 1).

| Tier | Capital Building | Gold Cost | Downtimes | Building Limit | Buildings required to build next tier's capital building |New Strongholds Allowed |
|:-----|:-----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| 1    | Outpost Tier     | 1,000     | 4         | 3              | 2                                                        |-                       |

| 5    | Kingdom Tier     | 75,000    | 12        | 14             | -                                                        |                        |


### Outpost Investment 
Your investment is more than just the building itself. Some types of buildings will also include construction of paths, roads and other infrastructure. 

For example, settlements with a caravansary automatically form roads or trade routes to other settlements, up to a number of miles away (25 per tier of the settlement). Travelling on these roads allows one to ignore the negative penalties of spending their downtime at a settlement other than where the quest begins.

See [Settlement Buildings](settlement_buildings.md) for more info.

## Outpost Feats
When players found a new outpost, they can pool their resources, but a single player that contributed will be put forward as controlling this outpost. They must describe what it is like to live there by giving the outpost a feat. When you upgrade an outpost to a higher tier of settlement the controller of the settlement comes up with an additional feat to give it.

Players make up their own feats for settlements. The list below contains some examples but is by no means meant to limit your creativity in making your settlement something special. You can choose from any in the list, or make up a new feat that will be added to the list. 

### Sample Feats

A settlement of the Outpost tier has a terrain feat as its first feat. Discuss what kind of terrain your settlement would have with a Dungeon Master before you pick it.  

Some example terrain feats are as follows:

| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Desert Oasis | Attracts anyone wandering the desert, trade is more effective for this settlement (Establishment is availabe at outpost tier) | Must get almost all their food through trading |
| Forest/Jungle Clearing | Fewer downtimes required to build wooden buildings | Traders often get lost and fail to find the settlement (Town tier is required for Establishments) |
| Sacred Grove | Gain a "Protected by friendly beasts" guards feat for free | Absolutely no woodcutting (buildings costs 500 additional gold per tier) |
| Holy Ground | Settlement is sanctified in the name of a specific god (Monestary, Temple, Grove are availabe at outpost tier) | Monestary, Temple and Grove strongholds here can only be dedicated to that god |
| Coastal Sprawl | Access to the sea for travel and trade (Establishment is availabe at outpost tier) | Storms can wreck your settlement, and you look delicious to pirates |
| Grasslands Community | Discount of mounts and carriages bought or hired here | Travelers and traders going to or from here cannot be stealthy |
| Hilltop Town | Natural defensible terrain against invaders (Keep, Fort and Fane are available at village tier) | Need to carry water uphill each day |
| Mountain Retreat | Rich Mineral deposits (Costs for building a Mine or Quarry is halved) | Difficult terrain diminishes all trade (Town tier is required for Establishments) |
| Flotilla | By being built from sea vessels this settlement can move | Each new building, stronghold or upgrade requires adding a sailing vessel to the flotilla as an additional cost |
| Cesspit | This settlement mainly eats rats and drinks tainted water, lack of food or water cannot hurt it | Diseases run rampant in this settlement, visitors will often contract them |
| Make Your Own |  |  |

## Village feats
Once an outpost grows into a village, the increased number of people living there should be included in the narrative of your village. They need something that brings them together, something they bond over, something that gives them guidance. What do the people of your village have in common? What makes the people of the village look at their neighbors and go “Yep, you belong here. This is our home.”?

Perhaps they are brought together by following a charismatic leader. Perhaps they are brought together following in service to a god. Perhaps they are brought together because they dislike authoritarian leaders and love democracy. Perhaps they are brought together because they hate living near temples and pushy preachers.
Perhaps they only love money, and all gathered in this town because there is plenty of opportunity for wealth.

The player controlling the settlement comes up with an additional feat to give to their settlement. Consider what kind of feat would best fit your settlement, faith, governance, something in between?

Some examples of these feats are as follows:
| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Pantheon: Mordinsamman (Faith) | The majority of the town follows the Dwarven pantheon, attracting mostly dwarves to live here and giving it a reputation of fairness and justice | Temples to non-dwarven gods remain empty and unused |
| Bureaucracy (Governance) | The village is a place of rules and bylaws, carefully managing who can do what, preventing villagers from revolting or abandoning the settlement to join bandits | Decisive action cannot be taken as changes happen slowly and needi to be considered and codified on paper first |
| Make your own | |


## Town feats
Once a village grows into a town, the improvements to its infrastructure and defenses make it a place to be reckoned with. The influence of the settlement's feats is no longer limited to just the town. The controller of the settlement creates a feat to represent their town effect on the lands around it with an additional feat.

A town might have squadrons of guards that patrol the roads around it, or it might be a haven for highwaymen that stalk the roads. A town might employ a cadre of elite mercenaries to deter would-be troublemakers, or hire a guild of assassins to strike back at anybody that dares cause problems for the town. Or perhaps something entirely different as the town exudes a divine aura of purity, or seeps corruption into the soil.

Some samples are as follows:
| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Commoner Militia (Guard) | Easy to train, easy to replace, there’s a lot of them | Not very brave or good detectives | 
| Elven Archers (Guard) | Really good lookouts, outrange most threats | Only have a scant few of these | 
| Momma Myrtle (Guard) | A halfling gossip discovers everything that happens in town within minutes of it happening, and her toughest cousins can wrestle wolves and bullseye birds with the best of them | Myrtle’s boys won’t lift a finger unless Myrtle decides this trouble is worth fighting |
| Pirate Cove (Crime) | Rough and tough sailors can take you anywhere, anytime, no questions asked (as long as it's by sea), and may give you their booty if you invest in them | Item prices skyrocket as legal trade to the settlement grinds to a halt | 
| Thieves Guild (Crime) | You might get information or items of extremely rare (albeit dubious) quality | Crime in the town is a permanent and unbeatable issue |
| Make your own | |

## City Feats
Once a town grows into a city, that means its power over the surrounding lands has become hugely impactful. Farming villages pop up in the shadow of the city’s walls, sharing the City’s culture and supplying, as well as benefiting from, the city’s resources. Things at home are now fairly well in hand, and it is time for your settlement to turn it’s attention outwards. The player controlling the city gives it a feat to narratively portray the effect it has beyond its borders. 

Perhaps your’s is a city state with a fearsome army, making military alliances with its neighbors or extorting them for tribute. Perhaps your city is known for wealth and influence, princes and princesses from faraway nations come begging to marry into the ruling class for the prestige alone. Perhaps your city is home to unparalleled innovations, guilds of inventors creating wonders found nowhere else, or powerful mages train future generations of arcane experts to serve the city.

| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Undead Horde (Army) | Your fearless and witless army of minor undead marches without supply nor strategy, striking fear into your foes | Your army cannot retreat, surrender, accept surrender or take prisoners. If you deploy it, you either completely wipe out your foes, their cities, and their people, or lose your army |
| Warrior Kings (Nobility) | The lords of this city can hold their own on the battlefield as well as in a courtroom | The noble families hold many grudges between one another, sometimes a civil duel will resolve things, but other times they resort to more troublesome forms of retribution |
| Wizard's College (Guild) | Magic items may be cheaper due to all the cheap intern labor available | Large scale devastating arcane accidents may occur |
| Make your own | | 

## Kingdom Feats
Once a city state grows into a kingdom, its influence now goes over that mountain and past that river, no longer hindered by natural obstacles. The culture of a kingdom strongly influences other settlements, even those not allied with it. The controller of the kingdom fills out their culture by adding 1 feat from any of the previous tiers, and if they'd like they can replace 1 feat they have with a feat from any tier.

### Making your own settlement feats:

1. Create a new name that clearly represents what the feat describes about the settlement. 
   1. You cannot make a feat with a name that someone has already created a feat for.
2. Devise an advantage the feat gives your settlement and a disadvantage the feat gives your settlement. 
3. Then, contact a DM with your proposed feat, that DM will check it against the examples to see if it is reasonable and perhaps advise you on how to describe it in a way that is both short and sweet. 
4. Once you and the DM agree the feat is ready, the DM will tell the other DMs about the feat and add it to the list below so nobody else can make a feat with that name.

### Mechanics to consider:
Through its feats, you are creating the unique story of your settlement. 

When you do so, consider that the settlement needs food, water, shelter and people to exist and grow. If a settlement is missing 1 of these it can usually engage in trade to make up for what they lack.

When describing the (dis)advantages of a settlement, consider if they have enough of those things to keep growing. Perhaps your advantage is to fix something the settlement lacks, or you describe in your disadvantage that there is something that this settlement is struggling with.
