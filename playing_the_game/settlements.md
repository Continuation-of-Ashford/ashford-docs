## Founding an Outpost
Settlements are built around a capital building, that brings the community together. 
This costs money and downtime, players can pool their money and downtimes together to build faster.
That investment isn't only the building, it includes [roads, settlement buildings, and other infrastructure](settlement_buildings.md).
The tier of your settlement and its infractructure determines how many buildings with usefull effects it can support.
If you wish to build a [stronghold](strongholds.md), it must be supported by a settlement.    

| Capital Building | Gold Cost | Downtimes | Building Limit | 
|:-----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| Outpost Tier     | 1,000     | 4         | 3              |
| Village Tier     | 5,000     | 6         | 5              | 
| Town Tier        | 15,000    | 8         | 8              | 
| City Tier        | 35,000    | 10        | 11             | 
| Kingdom Tier     | 75,000    | 12        | 14             |

Settlements automatically form roads or trade routes to other settlements, up to a number of miles away (25 per tier of the settlement.  Travelling on these roads allows one to ignore the negative penalties of spending their downtime at a settlement other than where the quest begins.

## Outpost Feats
When players found a new outpost, they can pool their resources, but a single player that contributed will be put forward as controlling this outpost.
They must describe what it is like to live there by giving the outpost a feat. When you upgrade an outpost to a higher tier of settlement the controller of the settlement comes up with an additional feat to give it.

Players make up their own feats for settlements. The list in this channel are some examples but is by no means meant to limit your creativity in making your settlement something special. You can choose from any in the list, or make up a new feat that will be added to the list. 

## Making your own settlement feats:
First, you come up with a new name that clearly represents what the feat describes about the settlement. You cannot make a feat with a name that someone has already created a feat for.
You come up with an advantage the feat gives your settlement and a disadvantage the feat gives your settlement. You contact a DM with your proposed feat, that DM will check it against the examples to see if it is reasonable and perhaps advise you on how to describe it in a way that is both short and sweet. Once you and the DM agree the feat is ready the DM will tell the other DMs about the feat and add it to the list below so nobody else can make a feat with that name.
For example terrain feats, we have some [sample terrain feats](example_terrain_feats.md).

## Mechanics to consider:
Through its feats you are creating the unique story of your settlement. When you do so, consider that the settlement needs food, water, shelter and people to exist and grow. If a settlement is missing 1 of these it can usually engage in trade to make up for what they lack.
When describing the (dis)advantages of a settlement, consider if they have enough of those things to keep growing. Perhaps your advantage is to fix something the settlement lacks, or you describe in your disadvantage that there is something that this settlement is struggling with.
