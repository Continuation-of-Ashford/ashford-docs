# Settlements
Settlements represent the efforts of players to inhabit and expand their influence throughout the world. They are meant to provide players and their characters with a connection to the land, while also providing mechanical benefits and customization options for the very world in which the server operates.

### Buildings
Settlements provide benefits to the owners and patrons of buildings in a settlement.

The types of buildings in a settlement provide different benefits, including additional downtime and purchasing options. It's important to check what is available in the settlement you spend your downtime in before taking those actions. See [Settlement Buildings](settlement_buildings.md). 

#### Construction of Buildings
Players can pool their money and downtimes together to obtain particular benefits or purely to complete construction faster.

When multiple players contribute to the construction of a settlement or building, someone must be elected as the owner. *Keep track of who contributed what to buildings in the thread for your settlement!*

A settlement can construct any building of it's own tier or lower.

### Destruction of Buildings
Settlement buildings can also be destroyed. Doing so incurs a cost in gold and downtimes equal to one quarter the building's original cost (minimum 1 downtime rounded up, 125gp rounded up to nearest 5gp increment).

The cost of deconstruction is paid by the settlement owner and distributed equally to any players other than the settlement owner who contributed to the building's original construction costs. 

If the building is not yet complete, there is no gold cost associated with the destruction.

### Management of Buildings 
Settlement owners have ultimate control over what can be built and destroyed in their settlement.

The tier of the settlement and its infractructure determines how many buildings with useful effects it can support.

### Building Limits
Each tier of settlement has a limit on the number and tier of buildings that can be constructed. If the settlement has reached its building limit, another building must be destroyed before the settlement can begin construction on any others. 

A building counts towards the settlement's building limit as soon as it begins construction and stops counting towards it after completely destroyed.

### Upgrading Settlements 
Each tier of settlement has a building requirement that must be met before it can be upgraded to the next tier. 

See [Settlement Buildings](settlement_buildings.md) to see the building pre-requisites.

See the General Settlements Rules [table](#settlements-table) for number of required buildings.

### Strongholds
Strongholds are a special kind of building that are owned by players, not the settlement owner. 

Strongholds do not count towards a settlement's building limit.

Strongholds cannot be destroyed by anyone other than the owner of the Stronghold or by DMs, as deemed appropriate in the context of the server plot.

If you wish to build a [stronghold](strongholds.md), it must be supported by a settlement of an appropriate tier. Establishments can be built at Tier 2 (Village), while other can begin being built at Tier 3 (Town)

Strongholds have their own rules which can be found [here](strongholds.md).

# Founding a Settlement
Settlements are built around a capital building that brings the community together. Of course, this costs money and your characters will need to spend their time between adventures (downtimes) constructing those buildings. 

All settlements start as an Outpost. In order to found an Outpost, you must:
1. Build a Trade Post in terrain (see below) that is different from the nearest settlement to where you want to build one. 
   1. Ask your Dungeon Master if a particular terrain is an appropriate location and distance from other settlements.
2. Complete contruction of your Trade Post.
3. Make a post naming your settlement in the `#settlments-tab` channel in discord, where it will be made into a thread by a Dungeon Master. 
   1. That thread will be used to track the progress of buildings and strongholds in the settlement.
4. Design and assign your settlement an Outpost Feat.  

# Settlement Feats
Settlement owners must describe what it is like to live there by giving their settlement a Feat. 

Whenever a settlement is upgraded to the next tier, the settlement owner must assign an additional feat to it. Players create their own feats for settlements. 

Below you'll find guidelines and examples of feats at each tier, but is by no means meant to limit your creativity in making your settlement something special. You can choose from any in the list, or make up a new feat that will be added to the list. 

### Making Your Own Settlement Feats

1. Create a new name that clearly represents what the feat describes about the settlement. 
   1. You cannot make a feat with a name that someone has already created a feat for.
2. Devise an advantage the feat gives your settlement and a disadvantage the feat gives your settlement. 
3. Then, contact a DM with your proposed feat, that DM will check it against the examples to see if it is reasonable and perhaps advise you on how to describe it in a way that is both short and sweet. 
4. Once you and the DM agree the feat is ready, the DM will tell the other DMs about the feat and add it to the list below so nobody else can make a feat with that name.

#### Considerations
Through its feats, you are creating the unique story of your settlement. 

When you do so, consider that the settlement needs food, water, shelter and people to exist and grow. If a settlement is missing 1 of these it can usually engage in trade to make up for what they lack.

When describing the (dis)advantages of a settlement, consider if they have enough of those things to keep growing. Perhaps your advantage is to fix something the settlement lacks, or you describe in your disadvantage that there is something that this settlement is struggling with.

## Outpost Feats
A settlement of the Outpost tier has a terrain feat. Discuss what kind of terrain your settlement is in with a Dungeon Master before creating your new feat.

Some example terrain feats are as follows:

| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Desert Oasis | Attracts anyone wandering the desert, trade is more effective for this settlement (Establishment is availabe at Outpost tier) | Must get almost all their food through trading |
| Forest/Jungle Clearing | Fewer downtimes required to build wooden buildings | Traders often get lost and fail to find the settlement (Town tier is required for Establishments) |
| Sacred Grove | Gain a "Protected by friendly beasts" guards feat for free | Absolutely no woodcutting (buildings costs 500 additional gold per tier) |
| Holy Ground | Settlement is sanctified in the name of a specific god (Monestary, Temple, Grove are availabe at Outpost tier) | Monestary, Temple and Grove strongholds here can only be dedicated to that god |
| Coastal Sprawl | Access to the sea for travel and trade (Establishment is availabe at Outpost tier) | Storms can wreck your settlement, and you look delicious to pirates |
| Grasslands Community | Discount of mounts and carriages bought or hired here | Travelers and traders going to or from here cannot be stealthy |
| Hilltop Town | Natural defensible terrain against invaders (Keep, Fort and Fane are available at Village tier) | Need to carry water uphill each day |
| Mountain Retreat | Rich Mineral deposits (Costs for building a Mine or Quarry is halved) | Difficult terrain diminishes all trade (Town tier is required for Establishments) |
| Flotilla | By being built from sea vessels this settlement can move | Each new building, stronghold or upgrade requires adding a sailing vessel to the flotilla as an additional cost |
| Cesspit | This settlement mainly eats rats and drinks tainted water, lack of food or water cannot hurt it | Diseases run rampant in this settlement, visitors will often contract them |
| Make Your Own |  |  |

## Village Feats
Once an Outpost grows into a Village, the increased number of people living there should be included in the narrative of your Village. They need something that brings them together, something they bond over, something that gives them guidance. What do the people of your Village have in common? What makes the people of the Village look at their neighbors and go “Yep, you belong here. This is our home.”?

Perhaps they are brought together by following a charismatic leader. Perhaps they are brought together following in service to a god. Perhaps they are brought together because they dislike authoritarian leaders and love democracy. Perhaps they are brought together because they hate living near temples and pushy preachers. Perhaps they only love money, and all gathered in this Town because there is plenty of opportunity for wealth.

The player controlling the settlement comes up with an additional feat to give to their settlement. Consider what kind of feat would best fit your settlement, faith, governance, something in between?

Some examples of these feats are as follows:
| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Pantheon: Mordinsamman (Faith) | The majority of the Town follows the Dwarven pantheon, attracting mostly dwarves to live here and giving it a reputation of fairness and justice | Temples to non-dwarven gods remain empty and unused |
| Bureaucracy (Governance) | The Village is a place of rules and bylaws, carefully managing who can do what, preventing Villagers from revolting or abandoning the settlement to join bandits | Decisive action cannot be taken as changes happen slowly and needi to be considered and codified on paper first |
| Make your own | |


## Town Feats
Once a Village grows into a Town, the improvements to its infrastructure and defenses make it a force to be reckoned with. The influence of the settlement's feats is no longer limited to just the Town. The controller of the settlement creates a feat to represent their Town effect on the lands around it with an additional feat.

A Town might have squadrons of guards that patrol the roads around it, or it might be a haven for highwaymen that stalk the roads. A Town might employ a cadre of elite mercenaries to deter would-be troublemakers, or hire a guild of assassins to strike back at anybody that dares cause problems for the Town. Or perhaps something entirely different as the Town exudes a divine aura of purity, or seeps corruption into the soil.

Some samples are as follows:
| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Commoner Militia (Guard) | Easy to train, easy to replace, there's a lot of them | Not very brave or good detectives | 
| Elven Archers (Guard) | Really good lookouts, outrange most threats | Only have a scant few of these | 
| Momma Myrtle (Guard) | A halfling gossip discovers everything that happens in Town within minutes of it happening, and her toughest cousins can wrestle wolves and bullseye birds with the best of them | Myrtle's boys won't lift a finger unless Myrtle decides this trouble is worth fighting |
| Pirate Cove (Crime) | Rough and tough sailors can take you anywhere, anytime, no questions asked (as long as it's by sea), and may give you their booty if you invest in them | Item prices skyrocket as legal trade to the settlement grinds to a halt | 
| Thieves Guild (Crime) | You might get information or items of extremely rare (albeit dubious) quality | Crime in the Town is a permanent and unbeatable issue |
| Make your own | |

## Citystate Feats
Once a Town grows into a City, that means its power over the surrounding lands has become hugely impactful. 

Farming Villages pop up in the shadow of the Citystate's walls, sharing the Citystate's culture and supplying, as well as benefiting from, the Citystate's resources. Things at home are now fairly well in hand, and it is time for your settlement to turn it's attention outwards. The player controlling the Citystate gives it a feat to narratively portray the effect it has beyond its borders. 

Perhaps your's is a Citystate with a fearsome army, making military alliances with its neighbors or extorting them for tribute. Perhaps your Citystate is known for wealth and influence, princes and princesses from faraway nations come begging to marry into the ruling class for the prestige alone. Perhaps your Citystate is home to unparalleled innovations, guilds of inventors creating wonders found nowhere else, or powerful mages train future generations of arcane experts to serve the Citystate.

| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Undead Horde (Army) | Your fearless and witless army of minor undead marches without supply nor strategy, striking fear into your foes | Your army cannot retreat, surrender, accept surrender or take prisoners. If you deploy it, you either completely wipe out your foes, their cities, and their people, or lose your army |
| Warrior Kings (Nobility) | The lords of this Citystate can hold their own on the battlefield as well as in a courtroom | The noble families hold many grudges between one another, sometimes a civil duel will resolve things, but other times they resort to more troublesome forms of retribution |
| Wizard's College (Guild) | Magic items may be cheaper due to all the cheap intern labor available | Large scale devastating arcane accidents may occur |
| Make your own | | 

## Kingdom Feats
Once a Citystate grows into a Kingdom, its influence now goes over that mountain and past that river, no longer hindered by natural obstacles. The culture of a Kingdom strongly influences other settlements, even those not allied with it. The controller of the Kingdom fills out their culture by adding 1 feat from any of the previous tiers, and if they'd like they can replace 1 feat they have with a feat from any tier.
