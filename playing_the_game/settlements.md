# Settlements
## Founding an Outpost
Settlements are built around a capital building that brings the community together. Of course, this costs money and your characters will need to spend their time between adventures (downtimes) constructing those buildings. Fortunately, players can pool their money and downtimes together to build faster.

The tier of your settlement and its infractructure determines how many buildings with useful effects it can support.

If you wish to build a [stronghold](strongholds.md), it must be supported by a settlement of an appropriate tier. Establishments can be built at Tier 2 (Village), while other can begin being built at Tier 3 (Town)

| Tier | Capital Building | Gold Cost | Downtimes | Building Limit | New Strongholds Allowed |
|:-----|:-----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|:------------------------|
| 1    | Outpost Tier     | 1,000     | 4         | 3              | -                       |
| 2    | Village Tier     | 5,000     | 6         | 5              | Establishments          |
| 3    | Town Tier        | 15,000    | 8         | 8              | Temple, Tower, Keep     |
| 4    | City Tier        | 35,000    | 10        | 11             | -                       |
| 5    | Kingdom Tier     | 75,000    | 12        | 14             | -                       |


### Outpost Investment 
You should know that your investment is more than just the building itself. Some types of buildings will also include construction of paths, roads and other infrastructure. 

For example, settlements with a caravansary automatically form roads or trade routes to other settlements, up to a number of miles away (25 per tier of the settlement). Travelling on these roads allows one to ignore the negative penalties of spending their downtime at a settlement other than where the quest begins.

See [Settlement Buildings](settlement_buildings.md) for more info.

## Outpost Feats
When players found a new outpost, they can pool their resources, but a single player that contributed will be put forward as controlling this outpost. They must describe what it is like to live there by giving the outpost a feat. When you upgrade an outpost to a higher tier of settlement the controller of the settlement comes up with an additional feat to give it.

Players make up their own feats for settlements. The list below contains some examples but is by no means meant to limit your creativity in making your settlement something special. You can choose from any in the list, or make up a new feat that will be added to the list. 

### Sample Feats

A settlement of the Outpost tier usually has a terrain feat as its first feat. 

Some examples are as follows:

| Name | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------|
| Desert Oasis | Attracts anyone wandering the desert, trade is more effective for this settlement (Establishment is availabe at outpost tier) | Must get almost all their food through trading |
| Forest/Jungle Clearing | Fewer downtimes required to build wooden buildings | Traders often get lost and fail to find the settlement (Town tier is required for Establishments) |
| Sacred Grove | Gain a "Protected by friendly beasts" guards feat for free | Absolutely no woodcutting (buildings costs 500 additional gold per tier) |
| Holy Ground | Settlement is sanctified in the name of a specific god (Monestary, Temple, Grove are availabe at outpost tier) | Monestary, Temple and Grove strongholds here can only be dedicated to that god |
| Coastal Sprawl | Access to the sea for travel and trade (Establishment is availabe at outpost tier) | Storms can wreck your settlement, and you look delicious to pirates |
| Grasslands Community | Discount of mounts and carriages bought or hired here | Travelers and traders going to or from here cannot be stealthy |
| Hilltop Town | Natural defensible terrain against invaders (Keep, Fort and Fane are available at village tier) | Need to carry water uphill each day |
| Mountain Retreat | Rich Mineral deposits (Costs for building a Mine or Quarry is halved) | Difficult terrain diminishes all trade (Town tier is required for Establishments) |
| Flotilla | By being built from sea vessels this settlement can move | Each new building, stronghold or upgrade requires adding a sailing vessel to the flotilla as an additional cost |
| Cesspit | This settlement mainly eats rats and drinks tainted water, lack of food or water cannot hurt it | Diseases run rampant in this settlement, visitors will often contract them |
| Make Your Own |  |  |

### Making your own settlement feats:

1. Create a new name that clearly represents what the feat describes about the settlement. 
   1. You cannot make a feat with a name that someone has already created a feat for.
2. Devise an advantage the feat gives your settlement and a disadvantage the feat gives your settlement. 
3. Then, contact a DM with your proposed feat, that DM will check it against the examples to see if it is reasonable and perhaps advise you on how to describe it in a way that is both short and sweet. 
4. Once you and the DM agree the feat is ready, the DM will tell the other DMs about the feat and add it to the list below so nobody else can make a feat with that name.

### Mechanics to consider:
Through its feats, you are creating the unique story of your settlement. 

When you do so, consider that the settlement needs food, water, shelter and people to exist and grow. If a settlement is missing 1 of these it can usually engage in trade to make up for what they lack.

When describing the (dis)advantages of a settlement, consider if they have enough of those things to keep growing. Perhaps your advantage is to fix something the settlement lacks, or you describe in your disadvantage that there is something that this settlement is struggling with.
