# Strongholds
These are the strongholds players can build in their [settlements](settlements.md).  Strongholds differ from [regular buildings](settlement_buildings.md) in that a single building will have multiple levels which span multiple tiers of settlements and that they are controlled individually by the builder (i.e., someone builds a wizard's tower and decides that all abjuration wizards can gain its benefits from taking an extended rest there) You should make a note of who is/is not allowed to use your stronghold in its building entry in the settlements tab in discord. You must have a capital building of an appropriate tier to upgrade your stronghold to its next level.
When you take an extended rest at a stronghold, you gain the [class feature improvements](class_feature_improvements.md) associated with the class the stronghold is designated for.  Strongholds must have their class designated when they are constructed (i.e., you might decide that your tower gives fighters an impeccable view of the surrounding landscape allowing them to adapt their battle plans, so your tower would give class feature improvements to fighters, and only fighters.)

## Establishment
An Establishment is a place of business of some sort, it could be a shop, an inn, tavern or hotel, a warehouse, a merchant ship or a casino.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 6,000gp       | 5                 |
| 1     | 2,000gp       | 3                 |
| 2     | 4,000gp       | 6                 |
| 3     | 6,000gp       | 9                 |
| 4     | 8,000gp       | 12                |

### Demesne effect
An establishment doesn’t add a feat to the settlement it is constructed in, it instead enables or changes a downtime of your choice. Usually this is the Work Downtime with 4 skill or tool proficiencies of your choice. However you might instead choose to have your Establishment provide a place players can use the Pit Fighting or Gambling downtimes.

You can choose to allow all players to use your Establishment’s downtimes, or declare that only certain players are allowed to. 

### Extended Rest: Generate Income
Taking an extended rest at your Establishment allows you to earn gold from the business your establishment conducts. Roll a 2D4 and then add your Establishments level and the Settlement’s level to the result. Then multiply that result by 2d100, to find out how much gold you’ve earned.

## Temple
While called a temple, the only actual requirement is that this is a gathering place for people or creatures. It might be a church, a monastery, a grove in nature, a mercenary guild, a gladiatorial arena or a stable of exotic creatures.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 8,000gp       | 6                 |
| 1     | 3,000gp       | 4                 |
| 2     | 6,000gp       | 8                 |
| 3     | 12,000gp      | 12                |
| 4     | 18,000gp      | 16                |

### Demesne effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. 

For a temple this should be a Faith or Guilds feat. If the Settlement already has a feat of that type, you still add the new feat, but if the controller of the settlement agrees you can replace the existing feat with an Underworld feat. 

### Extended Rest: Recruit Servitor 
Taking an extended rest at a Temple allows you to recruit a Servitor to be your ally or mount. 

Roll a D100 and add 2 × your level to determine what kind of Servitor you can recruit. Servitors could be envoys sent by a divine or eldritch patron, or they might be mercenaries you pay or monstrosities or beasts you’ve tamed. 

Determine what is the appropriate type of creature based on how you’ve described your stronghold.

Servitors are inclined to follow and aid you, but they are their own creatures and may have taboos or needs that make them unable to follow your commands. Your servitor will stop following you when you take another extended rest. Some servitors will also be offended and stop following you if you give them commands they consider suicidal or otherwise are taboo. 

#### Servitor Table
| d100 Roll | S&F Servitor      | Equivalent |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 0-14      | \-                | CR 2       |
| 15-29     | \-                | CR 3       |
| 30-44     | \-                | CR 4       |
| 45-54     | Type I Servitor   | CR 5       |
| 55-64     | Type II Servitor  | CR 6       |
| 65-74     | Type III Servitor | CR 7       |
| 75-79     | Type IV Servitor  | CR 8       |
| 80-84     | Type V Servitor   | CR 9       |
| 95+       | Type VI Servitor  | CR 10      |

## Tower
While called a tower, the only actual requirement is that this is a research facility. It might be a tower, a fane, a laboratory, a testing ground or a botanical greenhouse.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 8,000gp       | 6                 |
| 1     | 3,000gp       | 4                 |
| 2     | 6,000gp       | 8                 |
| 3     | 12,000gp      | 12                |
| 4     | 18,000gp      | 16                |

### Demesne Effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. 

For a tower this should be a Guilds feat, as your stronghold can house apprentices that function as a Guild. If the Settlement already has a Guilds feat, you still add a new Guilds feat, but if the controller of the settlement agrees you can replace the Guilds feat the settlement previously had with an Underworld feat, or a Terrain feat of your design/choice.

### Extended Rest: Study (Magic School)
Taking an extended rest at a tower allows you to choose a single spell from the tower’s school. It doesn’t have to be a spell you can cast, nor does it need to be on your class’s spell list. Even non casters can benefit from a tower if they have items they can use to cast spells. 

When you cast that spell at its lowest level, resolve its effects as if the spell were cast at one level higher. In other words, Magic Missile, produced from a Wand of Magic Missiles, studied at an evocation tower, would cast as a 2nd-level spell, even though you used only one charge from the wand. 

Taking an extended rest elsewhere causes you to lose the effect of the studied spell.

## Keep
While called a keep, the only actual requirement is that this is a military facility. It might be a fort, but could just as well be a war ship bristling with cannons or army encampment teeming with orcs.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 10,000gp      | 8                 |
| 1     | 5,000gp       | 5                 |
| 2     | 10,000gp      | 10                |
| 3     | 15,000gp      | 15                |
| 4     | 20,000gp      | 20                |

### Demesne Effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. 

For a keep this should be a Guards feat. If the Settlement already has a Guards feat, you still add a new Guards feat, but if the controller of the settlement agrees you can replace the Guards feat the settlement previously had with an Underworld feat, or a Standing Army feat of your design/choice.

### Extended Rest: Training
Taking an extended rest at a keep grants you a training benefit. You cannot gain the benefit of training from armor, shields, or weapons you are not proficient in. Taking an extended rest elsewhere causes you to lose your training benefit until you take an extended rest at your keep again.

#### Keep Training
| Training | Benefit |
| :----------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light armor  | You have advantage on Dexterity checks while wearing light armor. (that includes initiative checks)                                              |

| Slashing     | You deal an extra 1d6 damage to creatures wearing light, natural, or no armor.                                                                   |
| Reach        | If you hit with a reach weapon, you can move the target 5 feet, but they must remain within your reach.                                          |
| Shield       | If you succeed in a weapon attack while wielding a shield, you can push your target 5 feet away from you.                                        |
| Versatile    | While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain +1 AC.                                                                                  |
