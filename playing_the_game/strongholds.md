# Strongholds
Strongholds differ from [regular buildings](settlement_buildings.md) in that a single building will have multiple levels which span multiple tiers of settlements and that they are controlled individually by the builder, not the settlement owner.

You should make a note of who is/is not allowed to use your Stronghold in its building entry in the settlements tab in discord. The settlement that your Stronghold is located in must contain a capital building of an appropriate tier to upgrade your Stronghold to its next level.  The tier of capital building required to upgrade your stronghold is equal to the level of the stronghold plus 1 (i.e., in order to build a level 4 keep, you need a tier 5 settlement).

Below you'll find the the Strongholds players can build in [settlements](settlements.md). 

### Benefits
Settlements provide benefits available to all players in a settlement (Demesne Effect and Extended Rest), as well as owner-specific benefits called Class Feature Improvements that are activated on an Extended Rest downtime action.

### Class Feature Improvements
When your Stronghold reaches level 1, you must choose a class which you currently have levels in to associate it with. For example, if you have 3 levels of Barbarian and 3 of Fighter, you can choose either. However, if you only have 6 in Barbarian, you can only choose Barbarian.

When you take an Extended Rest at your Stronghold of level 1 or higher as your [Downtime Action](downtime_actions.md), you gain both the benefits of the Extended Rest as well as the [Class Feature Improvements](class_feature_improvements.md) associated with the class the Stronghold is designed for.

Only the owner of the Stronghold can benefit from a Class Feature Improvement.

#### Reclassifying Your Stronghold
At each upgrade of your Stronghold, you can choose to change the class associated with it, bound by the same limitation of character levels. 

You can also reclassify your Stronghold between tiers. This comes with a cost in gold and downtimes to remodel and reconfigure your Stronghold for its new uses.

Cost:
1. A number of downtimes equal to 1/3 the downtimes required to construct the current Stronghold level (rounded down).
2. An amount of gold equal to 1/2 the current gold required to construct the current Stronghold level (rounded up to the nearest 100gp increment).

# Establishment
An Establishment is a place of business of some sort, it could be a shop, an inn, tavern or hotel, a warehouse, a merchant ship or a casino.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 6,000gp       | 5                 |
| 1     | 2,000gp       | 3                 |
| 2     | 4,000gp       | 6                 |
| 3     | 6,000gp       | 9                 |
| 4     | 8,000gp       | 12                |

## Demesne effect
An establishment doesn't add a feat to the settlement it is constructed in, it instead enables or changes a downtime of your choice in that settlement. Usually this is the Work Downtime with 4 skill or tool proficiencies of your choice. However you might instead choose to have your Establishment provide a place players can use the Pit Fighting or Gambling downtimes.

You can choose to allow all players to use your Establishment's downtimes, or declare that only certain players are allowed to. 

## Extended Rest: Generate Income
Taking an extended rest at your Establishment allows you to earn gold from the business your establishment conducts. Roll a 2D4 and then add your Establishments level and the Settlement's level to the result. Then multiply that result by 2d100, to find out how much gold you've earned.

# Temple
While called a temple, the only actual requirement is that this is a gathering place for people or creatures. It might be a church, a monastery, a grove in nature, a mercenary guild, a gladiatorial arena or a stable of exotic creatures.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 8,000gp       | 6                 |
| 1     | 3,000gp       | 4                 |
| 2     | 6,000gp       | 8                 |
| 3     | 12,000gp      | 12                |
| 4     | 18,000gp      | 16                |

## Demesne effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. 

For a temple this should be a Faith or Guilds feat. If the Settlement already has a feat of that type, you still add the new feat, but if the controller of the settlement agrees you can replace the existing feat with an Underworld feat. 

## Extended Rest: Recruit Servitor 
Taking an extended rest at a Temple allows you to recruit a Servitor to be your ally or mount. 

Roll a `1d100 + (2 Ã— your level)` to determine what kind of Servitor you can recruit. Servitors could be envoys sent by a divine or eldritch patron, or they might be mercenaries you pay or monstrosities or beasts you've tamed. 

Determine what is the appropriate type of creature based on how you've described your Stronghold and note it in the building entry in the settlement's thread in `#settlement-tab`.

Servitors are inclined to follow and aid you, but they are their own creatures and may have taboos or needs that make them unable to follow your commands. Your servitor will stop following you when you take another extended rest. Some servitors will also be offended and stop following you if you give them commands they consider suicidal or otherwise are taboo. 

### Servitor Table
| d100 Roll | S&F Servitor      | Equivalent |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 0-14      | \-                | CR 2       |
| 15-29     | \-                | CR 3       |
| 30-44     | \-                | CR 4       |
| 45-54     | Type I Servitor   | CR 5       |
| 55-64     | Type II Servitor  | CR 6       |
| 65-74     | Type III Servitor | CR 7       |
| 75-79     | Type IV Servitor  | CR 8       |
| 80-84     | Type V Servitor   | CR 9       |
| 95+       | Type VI Servitor  | CR 10      |

# Tower
While called a tower, the only actual requirement is that this is a research facility. It might be a tower, a fane, a laboratory, a testing ground or a botanical greenhouse.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 8,000gp       | 6                 |
| 1     | 3,000gp       | 4                 |
| 2     | 6,000gp       | 8                 |
| 3     | 12,000gp      | 12                |
| 4     | 18,000gp      | 16                |

### School of Magic
When you build your tower, you must choose a school of magic which is being researched. 

Choose one of the following and record it in your building records in `#settlement-tab`:
* Conjuration
* Necromancy
* Evocation
* Abjuration 
* Transmutation
* Divination
* Enchantment
* Illusion

## Demesne Effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. 

For a tower this should be a Guilds feat, as your Stronghold can house apprentices that function as a Guild. If the Settlement already has a Guilds feat, you still add a new Guilds feat, but if the controller of the settlement agrees you can replace the Guilds feat the settlement previously had with an Underworld feat, or a Terrain feat of your design/choice.

## Extended Rest: Study (Magic School)
Taking an extended rest at a tower allows you to improve your skills with and knowledge of a singular spell which you dedicate your study to. 

Choose a spell which you have access to via any source (class, subclass, race, item, etc) that matches the school of magic associated with the tower you are studying at. Whenever you cast that spell at its lowest level, resolve its effects as if the spell were cast at one level higher. Spells cast this this way still consume any required resources at the original level (spell slots, item charges, etc).

For example, a fighter who possesses a Wand of Magic Missile studies the Magic Missile spell at a tower specializing in Evocation magic. Whenever they cast the Magic Missile spell at 1st level, it casts as a 2nd-level spell while only consuming one charge from the wand.

You may also choose to study a spell you do not currently have access to for educational or theoretical purposes, but you will not gain the spellcasting benefits from this Extended Rest until you do have access to it.

This effect ends whenever you take another Extended Rest at any Stronghold.

# Keep
While called a keep, the only actual requirement is that this is a military facility. It might be a fort, but could just as well be a war ship bristling with cannons or army encampment teeming with orcs.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 10,000gp      | 8                 |
| 1     | 5,000gp       | 5                 |
| 2     | 10,000gp      | 10                |
| 3     | 15,000gp      | 15                |
| 4     | 20,000gp      | 20                |

## Demesne Effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. 

For a keep this should be a Guards feat. If the Settlement already has a Guards feat, you still add a new Guards feat, but if the controller of the settlement agrees you can replace the Guards feat the settlement previously had with an Underworld feat, or a Standing Army feat of your design/choice.

## Extended Rest: Training
Taking an extended rest at a keep grants you a training benefit. You cannot gain the benefit of training from armor, shields, or weapons you are not proficient in. 

This effect ends whenever you take another Extended Rest at any Stronghold.

### Keep Training
