# Strongholds
Strongholds differ from [regular buildings](settlement_buildings.md) in that a single building will have multiple levels which span multiple tiers of settlements and that they are controlled individually by the builder, not the settlement owner.

You should make a note of who is/is not allowed to use your Stronghold in its building entry in the settlements tab in discord. The settlement that your Stronghold is located in must contain a capital building of an appropriate tier to upgrade your Stronghold to its next level.  The tier of capital building required to upgrade your stronghold is equal to the level of the stronghold plus 1 (i.e., in order to build a level 4 keep, you need a tier 5 settlement).

Below you'll find the the Strongholds players can build in [settlements](settlements.md). 

## Benefits
Each type of Stronghold provides a benefit to the settlement they are built in through a Demesne Effect. Each type of Stronghold also grants an Extended Rest benefit when the owner or someone the owner allows takes an extended rest there. When you Extended Rest at a Stronghold you own, you get an additional benefit called Class Feature Improvements.

### Class Feature Improvements
When your Stronghold reaches level 1, you must choose a class which you currently have levels in to associate it with. For example, if you have 3 levels of Barbarian and 3 of Fighter, you can choose either. However, if you only have 6 in Barbarian, you can only choose Barbarian when upgrading your Stronghold.

When you take an Extended Rest at your Stronghold of level 1 or higher as your [Downtime Action](downtime_actions.md), you gain both the benefits of the Extended Rest as well as the [Class Feature Improvements](class_feature_improvements.md) associated with the class the Stronghold is designed for.

Only the owner of the Stronghold can benefit from a Class Feature Improvement.

#### **Reclassifying Your Stronghold**
At each upgrade of your Stronghold, you can choose to change the class associated with it, bound by the same limitation of character levels. 

You can also reclassify your Stronghold between tiers. This comes with a cost in gold and downtimes to remodel and reconfigure your Stronghold for its new uses.

Cost:
1. A number of downtimes equal to 1/3 the downtimes required to construct the current Stronghold level (rounded down).
2. An amount of gold equal to 1/2 the current gold required to construct the current Stronghold level (rounded up to the nearest 100gp increment).

# Establishment
An Establishment is a place of business of some sort, it could be a shop, an inn, tavern or hotel, a warehouse, a merchant ship or a casino.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 6,000gp       | 5                 |
| 1     | 2,000gp       | 3                 |
| 2     | 4,000gp       | 6                 |
| 3     | 6,000gp       | 9                 |
| 4     | 8,000gp       | 12                |

## Demesne effect
An establishment doesn't add a feat to the settlement it is constructed in, it instead enables or enhances a downtime of your choice in the settlement it is in. 

### *Improve work*
Choose 4 skill or tool proficiencies for the Work Downtime, players spending their downtime working at your establishment add 5 to their roll.

### *Enable a downtime*
Your Establishment provides a place players can use a downtime they otherwise couldn't.   
Choose which packet of downtimes you enable: 
- Gambling + Pit Fighting
- Training Hall + Pit Fighting
- Crafting a Mundane Item (Armorsmith version) 
- Crafting a Mundane Item (Blacksmith version) 
- Crafting a Mundane Item (Weaponsmith version) 

### *Imports*
Choose a valid destination for the travel downtime, starting from the settlement where your establishment is. Players can now purchase any items that can be crafted in the target settlement for the item's listed costs.

### *Transport*
Choose a valid destination for the travel downtime, starting from the settlement where your establishment is. Players can now purchase any items that can be crafted in the target settlement for the item's listed costs.

You can choose to allow all players to use your Establishment's downtimes, or declare that only certain players are allowed to. 

## Extended Rest: Generate Income
Taking an extended rest at your Establishment allows you to earn gold from the business your establishment conducts. Roll a 2D4 and then add your Establishments level and the Settlement's level to the result. Then multiply that result by 2d100, to find out how much gold you've earned.

# Temple
While called a temple, the only actual requirement is that this is a gathering place for people or creatures. It might be a church, a monastery, a grove in nature, a mercenary guild, a gladiatorial arena or a stable of exotic creatures.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 8,000gp       | 6                 |
| 1     | 3,000gp       | 4                 |
| 2     | 6,000gp       | 8                 |
| 3     | 12,000gp      | 12                |
| 4     | 18,000gp      | 16                |

## Demesne effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. If you are not the controller of that settlement, its controller needs to approve the feat you add.

For a temple this should be a Faith or Guilds feat. If the Settlement already has a feat of that type, you still add the new feat, but if the controller of the settlement would like to, they can replace the existing feat with an Underworld feat. 

## Extended Rest: Recruit Servitor 
Taking an extended rest at a Temple allows you to recruit a Servitor to be your ally or mount. 

Roll a `1d100 + (2 Ã— your level)` to determine what kind of Servitor you can recruit. Servitors could be envoys sent by a divine or eldritch patron, or they might be mercenaries you pay or monstrosities or beasts you've tamed. 

Determine what is the appropriate type of creature based on how you've described your Stronghold and the faith or guilds feat it adds to the settlement. Make a note of this as part of the feat description in `#settlement-tab`.

Servitors are inclined to follow and aid you, but they are their own creatures and may have taboos or needs that make them unable to follow your commands. Your servitor will stop following you when you take another extended rest. Some servitors will also be offended and stop following you if you give them commands they consider suicidal or otherwise are taboo. 

The type of servitor you get is determined by the Faith or Guilds feat you added to the settlement when you built your stronghold. Recruited servitors are members of that guild or  followers/servants of that faith. The **DM determines** what their taboos might be **based on your description** of the type of creatures that would be following that faith or members of that guild. 

||
| --- |
| For example: *a Deva you summoned at a temple of Tyr, might leave your service if you command it to assist you in a robbery.* While *a Champion recruited at a mercenary guild, might leave your service if you command it to give away its equipment.* However *a giant elk you recruited at a druidic grove, wouldn't care about either of that.* |
A general guideline for DMs ruling these cases is that less socially influential a servitor is, the fewer moral scruples it has. The really clueless/shunned ones, *such as undead*, will even follow suicidal commands. |

Servitors based on statblocks that would have legendary actions, legendary resistances, or lair actions lose those traits while acting as servitors.

### Servitor Table
| d100 Roll | S&F Servitor      | Equivalent | Examples |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |:---------|
| 0-14      | \-                | CR 2       | Cult Fanatic, Druid, Pegasus |
| 15-29     | \-                | CR 3       | Archer, Knight, Veteran |
| 30-44     | \-                | CR 4       | Couatl, Orc Blade of Ilneval |
| 45-54     | Type I Servitor   | CR 5       | Gladiator, Kraken Priest |
| 55-64     | Type II Servitor  | CR 6       | Dragonborn of Sardior |
| 65-74     | Type III Servitor | CR 7       | Dragonborn of Tiamat |
| 75-79     | Type IV Servitor  | CR 8       | Dragonborn of Bahamut |
| 80-84     | Type V Servitor   | CR 9       | Champion, War Priest |
| 95+       | Type VI Servitor  | CR 10      | Deva, Githzerai Enlightened |

# Tower
While called a tower, the only actual requirement is that this is a research facility. It might be a tower, a fane, a laboratory, a testing ground or a botanical greenhouse.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 8,000gp       | 6                 |
| 1     | 3,000gp       | 4                 |
| 2     | 6,000gp       | 8                 |
| 3     | 12,000gp      | 12                |
| 4     | 18,000gp      | 16                |

### School of Magic
When you build your tower, you must choose a school of magic which is being researched. 

Choose one of the following and record it in your building records in `#settlement-tab`:
* Conjuration
* Necromancy
* Evocation
* Abjuration 
* Transmutation
* Divination
* Enchantment
* Illusion

## Demesne Effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. If you are not the controller of that settlement, its controller needs to approve the feat you add.

For a tower this should be a Guilds feat, as your Stronghold can house apprentices that function as a Guild. If the Settlement already has a Guilds feat, you still add a new Guilds feat, but if the controller of the settlement would like to, they can replace the Guilds feat the settlement previously had with an Underworld feat, or a Terrain feat of your design/choice.

## Extended Rest: Study (Magic School)
Taking an extended rest at a tower allows you to improve your skills with and knowledge of a singular spell which you dedicate your study to. 

Choose a spell which you have access to via any source (class, subclass, race, item, etc) that matches the school of magic associated with the tower you are studying at. Whenever you cast that spell at its lowest level, resolve its effects as if the spell were cast at one level higher. Spells cast this this way still consume any required resources at the original level (spell slots, item charges, etc).

For example, a fighter who possesses a Wand of Magic Missile studies the Magic Missile spell at a tower specializing in Evocation magic. Whenever they cast the Magic Missile spell at 1st level, it casts as a 2nd-level spell while only consuming one charge from the wand.

You may also choose to study a spell you do not currently have access to for educational or theoretical purposes, but you will not gain the spellcasting benefits from this Extended Rest until you do have access to it.

This effect ends whenever you take another Extended Rest at any Stronghold.

# Keep
While called a keep, the only actual requirement is that this is a military facility. It might be a fort, but could just as well be a war ship bristling with cannons or army encampment teeming with orcs.

| Level | Cost to Build/Upgrade | Downtimes to Build |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 10,000gp      | 8                 |
| 1     | 5,000gp       | 5                 |
| 2     | 10,000gp      | 10                |
| 3     | 15,000gp      | 15                |
| 4     | 20,000gp      | 20                |

## Demesne Effect
Your Stronghold adds a feat of your design/choice to the settlement it is in or near. If you are not the controller of that settlement, its controller needs to approve the feat you add.

For a keep this should be a Guards feat. If the Settlement already has a Guards feat, you still add a new Guards feat, but if the controller of the settlement would like to, they can replace the Guards feat the settlement previously had with an Underworld feat, or a Standing Army feat of your design/choice.

## Extended Rest: Training
Taking an extended rest at a keep grants you a training benefit. You cannot gain the benefit of training from armor, shields, or weapons you are not proficient in. 

This effect ends whenever you take another Extended Rest at any Stronghold.

### Keep Training

| :----------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
