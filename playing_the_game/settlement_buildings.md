# Settlement buildings
These are the buildings that can be constructed in [settlements](settlements.md).  Buildings can only be constructed if there is a capital building of their tier or above.   

In addition to these buildings, players can build some [strongholds](strongholds.md) for stronger personal benefits beginning when the settlement they are located in has reached tier 2.

`Note:` Buildings marked with a `*` are required to begin construction for the capital building of the next tier.
