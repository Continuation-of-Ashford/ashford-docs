# Armies and Warfare
# Commanding Armies
___
If you are the controller of a settlement with a standing army feat, you can give 1 order to each army you control after you spend a downtime. Even if you aren't playing the character that owns the settlement in the session the downtime belong to.

Should the controller of the settlement allow it, they can transfer control of an army granted by the demanse effect a Fort Stronghold, to the owner of that fort. But regardless of how many commanders are in the current session, each army can only execute 1 order.

### The Map
Armies move on a hex grid, overlayed on Greater Ashford. Each hex is the size of a small kingdom, 75 miles across. There are 3 types of hexes, landlocked hexes, coastal hexes and sea hexes.

____
Some hexes are intersected by mountains. Mountains in the center of a hex are navigatable, only mountains on the border of 2 hexes matter. When 1 edge of a hex is covered by mountains, that edge is impassible. If an edge is impassible due to mountains, the 2 hexes it connects cannot be considered adjascent.  Impassable borders will be appropriately marked.


### Giving Orders

There are three orders you can give: **Move/Attack**, **Assist**, or **Ferry**. An army not given an order will hold position.

## Move/Attack
The commander may order each unit they control to move to or attack an adjascent hex. Naturally, armies cannot move into sea hexes, and fleets cannot move into landlocked hexes. 

#### Orders
All move orders must be private messaged to a Dungeon Master, who will record them in a hidden channel.  These descisions are not locked in until all orders are in. The DM controlling the enemy armies decides what the NPC armies and fleets will do before the players tell the DM their orders (usually they'll just Hold & Assist) so that the DM doesn't change what the NPCs do based on the plans for the player armies. Likewise, the DM doesn't reveal what the NPCs are doing to the players until the players have locked in their orders, so the players can't adjust their orders based on what the NPCs will be doing.

There is an exception to this, spying and divination spells during sessions might reveal 1 NPC army's orders early.

**All orders will be executed weekly on Saturdays at 8 PM EST.**

At the appropriate time, all movement of armies and fleets happens at the same time. If an army tries to move into an occupied hex, or if 2 armies try to both move into the same hex, their move order becomes an attack order instead. 

If an army moves into a hex while another army is moving out of it, they don't block eachother. If this would cause 2 armies to switch places, the commanders of both armies can choose whether to pass by peacefully, or if a battle should occur.

____
Coastal hexes are special. A coastal hex can be occupied by 1 fleet and 1 army at the same time. When an army or fleet moves into an occupied coastal hex, their move order only becomes an attack order if the coastal hex is already occupied by a unit of the same type.

#### Attacking
Each army is theoretically equally matched with every other army. When 2 (or more) equal armies or fleets block eachother from moving the attack results in a stalemate, this cancels the movement order of any unit involved and causes them to remain in place.

## Assist
When an army Move/Attacks, any army that didn't recieve a Move/Attack order this week and is adjacent to the hex the the attacker is moving towards can Assist 1 army of their choice. Even if multiple battles are happening adjescent to a unit, they can choose only 1 battle per week to assist in.
___
Because all armies are equal, a 1v1 is always a stalemate. The only way to win battles is by using assists tactically. When an attack happens and the number of assists for each side is not equal only the army with the highest number of assists survives.

> It is possible a 3 way (or more) attack occurs, usually due to poor communication or planning. Either by 3 or more armies all trying to move into the same square, or by 2 or more armies trying to move into an occupied square. If someone chooses to assist, this can cause 1 army to wipe out multiple other armies in a single turn.

#### Fleets
Fleets work similar to armies when Moving/Attacking other fleets. Just like armies, if 2 fleets try to move into the same hex, or a fleet tries to move into a hex occupied by another fleet, their move orders become attack orders.   

All fleets are equally matched, so a 1v1 is always a stalemate. The only way to win sea battles is by one fleet being assisted.

#### Coastal Battles
Only when both an army and a fleet occupy the same coastal square, can fleets attack or assist armies or armies attack or assist fleets.

## Ferry
Normaly armies cannot move into sea hexes. However a fleet in a sea hex adjascent to a coastal hex can be ordered to ferry. A ferry order designates a target army that is allowed to move on top of the fleet using a Move/Attack order. The commander of the fleet then chooses 1 hex adjascent to the fleet to deposit the army into, provided that hex is a valid place for the army to be.

A valid place to deposit a ferried fleat can be a coastal hex, or another fleet that is also using the ferry action.

____
In this way, fleets can be used to move armies across the sea, or to leapfrog armies along a coastline by skipping 1 or more hexes. Without the fleets needing to enter the coastal squares where they'd be vulnerable to attack by an army.

## Sabotage by Players
Sessions may be run to sabotage enemy armies.  If these sessions are successful, they will be counted as an assist against the sabotaged army.

## Raiding
When an army or fleet is in a hex that contains an outpost or village, that army can be ordered to attack the settlement.

Attacking an unguarded settlement means raiding it. A raid rolls a 1d3 and destroyes that many buildings. The attacking army can choose which buildings it targets. This causes valuables, goods, equipment and people to be aquired by the raiding army equal to or less than the gold cost of destroying those buildings. That army will carry that with them until they deposit them somewhere; players could reclaim that loot from that army.

## Beseiging
A town, city, or kingdom requires the "Palisades or Guard post" building. While a settlement has that building it cannot be raided and is a guarded settlement. When ordered to attack a guarded settlement, armies must instead beseige the settlement. A guarded settlement counts as having 1 army, but that army doesn't occupy a hex and can't leave the settlement. This army can be further boosted by any guards or army feats the settlement may possess.  An attacking army will need support to not stalemate vs. the "army" of a guarded settlement. The "army" of a guarded settlement is able to support armies attacking an army that is in its settlement's hex, but can't otherwise recieve orders.
____
For each order to seige, the attacking army adds 1d3 to a pool of dice, each time this happens the settlement beign beseiged is asked to surrender to come under new management. While there are dice in the pool, that settlement cannot be traveled to or from, and characters in the settlement cannot spend downtimes to build or repair buildings.

Once that army's controller believes enough dice are in the pool, the time for surrender has passed and they roll the dice pool. The total of the roll is the number of buildings that are destroyed. The buildings targeted during a seige are chosen randomly with no regard to their gold cost.  If this destroys every building in a settlement, the settlement is considered [abandoned](settlements.md#abandoned-settlements)

The pool of dice for a seige is emptied after it is rolled, when the attacking army moves off of the hex the settlement is in, or when the attacking army is destroyed.
____

When one of the buildings the seige randomly destroys is the "Palisades or Guard post" building, the seige ends. The next order to the attacking army can be to raid the settlement, or take it over. 


## Standing Army Feat
When a players gives a standing army feat to a settlement the feat should declare whether the resulting unit is an army or a fleet. Only settlements with a port can produce fleets. Each feat can support an exact number of armies; the settlment cannot have more armies at once than that feat supports.  The feat should also describe what the army is comprised of. For example:

> Goblinhome is friendly to the local goblin tribes and can recruit from their number.  Goblinhome has 3 army units of Goblin Worg Rider Cavalry, which is an army that contains Goblins, Worgs and a small number of Goblin Chieftans riding Giant Boars.  

If a unit is defeated it will need to be reinforced at the settlement that has the feat it came from.   A unit who's home settlement was destroyed or captured can continue to recieve orders, but if it is defeated it will be dead forever.

#### Reinforcing
Reinforcing an army by default costs 10,000gp and 4 downtimes, to train, reqruit, and resupply. However some armies (usually monsters or undead) might have a "no survivors" advantage, that doubles the cost of reinforcing units destroyed by it.

#### Improving Units
You might choose to give your unit an extra 50% or extra 100% extra cost to reinforce as the disadvantage of the settlement feat, in order to apply an advantage to the mechanics of the feat's unit.
____
A unit created by players can never gain an advantage that allows it to self-assist or otherwise become able to kill opposing units without needing an Assist. But advantages you give your Army Feat can change how they interact with the mechanics in various other ways. For example:

- A unit of clerics that is good at buffing might have the ability to use Assist if they are adjascent to the hex the attacker moves out of, as well as being able to Assist as normal on hexes being moved into.
- A unit of flying creatures would be able to consider hexes seperated by mountainous borders as adjacent. 
- A fleet of submersibles or tamed Giant Sharks might lack the ability to Ferry units, but can be given a Move order to stay submerged on a sea hex, to count as moving out of the hex without actually moving.
