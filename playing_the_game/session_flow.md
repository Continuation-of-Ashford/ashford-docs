# Session Flow

## Downtime Actions

At the start of session, after joining the Foundry and Discord voice channel, privately PM your Downtime Actions to the Dungeon Master for the session.  You must state which settlement you are working in so the DM can account for the required travel. 

If your Downtime Action has consequences for the session gameplay, please also verbally notify the Dungeon Master after messaging it to them. 

See more: [Downtime Actions](downtime_actions.md).

## DM Notifications

### Start of Session

At the start of the session, please inform your Dungeon Master of any effects which might majorly impact balance or gameplay progression, such as:

* Homebrew items of other Dungeon Masters
* Weapons or class abilities/features such as Open Hand Monk's Tranquility class feature, or a weapon of warning
* Spells or other magical item effects cast prior to the in-universe day the mission starts (i.e. Contingency)

### End of Session

At the end of the session, please inform your Dungeon Master of any of the following:

* If a player wishes not to take the xp reward. The Dungeon Master will write this in the mission report and the player may receive or roll for magic items, if applicable, and half of the awarded gold.

## Quest Reports
A reward is given to players who give a sufficient report of the quest they participated in. 

This reward changes per level as follows: 

| Level | Reward                        |
|------ | ----------------------------- |
| 3-7   | 100 gp + 10% extra session xp |
| 8-12  | 200 gp + 10% extra session xp |
| 18-20 | 400 gp + 10% extra session xp |

## Disciplinary Actions
If a player is disturbing the session, the `Dungeon Master` has the power to remove the player. 

If a problem arises, try to hold off until the end of the session or direct message them so that the session can continue uninterupted. 

If there are repeat offenses, the DM will give one warning and past that disciplinary measures will be taken based on severity. Generally this ranges from no session rewards, to rescinding a downtime up to and including server ban. 

If the issue goes beyond the session an `Aedile` or `Big Mans` will come in to sort out the issue.
