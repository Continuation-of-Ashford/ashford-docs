# Session Flow
(`TODO`: move to sub-page? move to a "Running the Session" page?)

## Downtime Actions

At the start of session, after joining the Foundry and Discord voice channel, privately PM your Downtime Actions to the Dungeon Master for the session.  You must state which settlement you are working in so the DM can account for the required travel. 

If your Downtime Action has consequences for the session gameplay, please also verbally notify the Dungeon Master after messaging it to them. 

See more: [Downtime Actions](downtime_actions.md).

## DM Notifications

### Start of Session

At the start of the session, please inform your Dungeon Master of any effects which might majorly impact balance or gameplay progression, such as:

* Homebrew items of other Dungeon Masters
* Weapons or class abilities/features such as Open Hand Monk's Tranquility class feature, or a weapon of warning
* Spells or other magical item effects cast prior to the in-universe day the mission starts (i.e. Contingency)

### End of Session

At the end of the session, please inform your Dungeon Master of any of the following:

* If a player wishes not to take the xp reward. The Dungeon Master will write this in the mission report and the player may receive or roll for magic items, if applicable, and half of the awarded gold.
