# Class Feature Improvements (CFI)
Class feature improvements require a minimum stronghold level of 1. An extended rest is one downtime. A multiclass character can choose any one of their CFI and change this selection after an extended rest.
## Barbarian: 
Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points or score a critical hit, you can choose to make an additional weapon attack and move up to your speed. You can do this a number of times equal to twice your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Bard: 
When a character you have inspired uses your inspiration die on a roll, you can choose to add your stronghold level to the result before the roll is made. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest. 
## Cleric: 
When you use your Channel Divinity Class feature, a number of allies that you can see up to your wisdom modifier within 30 feet regain 3d8 hit points. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Druid: 
When you assume your Wild Shape, you may assume the form of any beast, monstrosity, fey, plant, or dragon, including those with a flying or swimming speed. You may use this ability to transform into a creature with a Challenge rating up to half your Druid level rounded up. All other Wild Shape restrictions and benefits apply (including using all of the form’s actions and abilities except lair and legendary actions). You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Fighter: 
Whenever you make the attack action via your Action Surge, you automatically hit with those attacks. You can do this for a number of surges equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Monk: 
Whenever you are attacked while you have unspent ki, you can ignore all of the attack’s effects except its damage. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Mystic: 
When you use your Psionic Mastery feature, you gain additional psi points equal to your stronghold level. This can be done a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Paladin: 
You can use your Divine Smite feature at the highest spell slot you have access to without expanding a spell slot. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an  extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Ranger: 
You can give an enemy vulnerability to a number of your weapon attacks equal to your stronghold level. You must take an extended rest to recharge this ability. 
Rogue: After you hit with a Sneak Attack, you may become invisible, as by the invisibility spell. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Sorcerer: 
You gain bonus sorcery points equal in number to twice your stronghold level. These bonus points only refresh when you take an extended rest. 
Warlock: You gain an extra spell slot. You may use this extra spell slot a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability. 
## Wizard:
When you lose concentration on a spell during your turn (such as when casting another concentration spell) you can sustain the effect of the spell without concentrating on it for a short while. You have a number of turns equal to your stronghold level, during which you can sustain a spell without concentrating on it. An extended rest refreshes those turns. 
## Artificer: 
For a number of minutes per day equal to your stronghold level, you can give all of your allies the benefits of your infusions.  If the infusion alters an item (i.e., enhanced defense) you pick which item is affected.  If it creates a new item (i.e., mind sharpener), your ally magically receives a duplicate of it.  This time does not need to be continuous, but must be spent in one-minute intervals.
