# Class Feature Improvements (CFI)
When your Stronghold reaches level 1, you must choose a class which you currently have levels in to associate it with. For example, if you have 3 levels of Barbarian and 3 of Fighter, you can choose either. However, if you only have 6 in Barbarian, you can only choose Barbarian.

When you take an Extended Rest at your Stronghold of level 1 or higher as your [Downtime Action](downtime_actions.md), you gain both the benefits of the Extended Rest as well as the [Class Feature Improvements](class_feature_improvements.md) associated with the class the Stronghold is designed for. 

Below you'll find the benefits available for each class. 

## Barbarian 
Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points or score a critical hit while raging, you can choose to make an additional weapon attack and move up to your speed. 

You can do this a number of times equal to twice your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability.

## Bard 
When you or a creature you have used your Bardic Inspiration on rolls your inspiration die, you can choose to add your Stronghold level to the result *before the roll is made*. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest.

## Cleric 
When you use your Channel Divinity class feature, a number of allies that you can see up to your Wisdom modifier within 30 feet regain `3d8 hit points`. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Druid 
When you assume your Wild Shape, you may assume the form of any `beast`, `monstrosity`, `fey`, `plant`, or `dragon`, including those with a flying or swimming speed. 

You may use this ability to transform into a creature with a `Challenge Rating` equal to the CR limit of your regular Wild Shape plus your Stronghold's level. 


Formula: `new Wild Shape CR limit` = `normal Wild Shape CR limit` + `Stronghold level`

All other Wild Shape restrictions and benefits apply (including using all of the formâ€™s actions and abilities except lair and legendary actions). 

Using this ability consumes two uses of your Wild Shape. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability.

## Fighter 
Whenever you use the Attack action during an Action Surge, you can choose to make it a Stronghold Surge. Any attacks made during a Stronghold Surge ignore the AC of the target and so automatically hit (this does not effect any other effects such as resistances). 

Using a Stronghold Surge expends both one Action Surge and one Stronghold Surge. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Monk 
If you are hit by an attack against your AC while you have unspent ki, you can spend 1 ki to force the attack to miss. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability.

## Mystic 
When you use your Psionic Mastery feature, you gain additional psi points equal to your Stronghold level. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Paladin 
You can use your Divine Smite feature at the highest spell slot you have access to without expanding a spell slot. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Ranger 
You can give an enemy vulnerability to a number of your weapon attacks equal to your Stronghold level. 

You must take an Extended Rest to recharge this ability.

# Rogue
After you hit with a Sneak Attack, you may become invisible. This functions as the invisibility spell, but it is nonmagical. 

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability.

## Sorcerer 
You gain bonus sorcery points equal in number to twice your Stronghold level. 

You must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Warlock 
You gain a number of Stronghold Spell Slots equal to the level of your Stronghold. 

On your turn, you can choose to use a Stronghold Spell Slot as if it were a Warlock Spell Slot.

You must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Wizard
You gain a number of Sustained Concentration Rounds equal to the level of your Stronghold. 

When you lose concentration on a spell during your turn (such as when casting another concentration spell) you can choose to sustain the effect of the spell without concentrating on it for a short while. Doing so immediately consumes one Sustained Concentration Rounds.

At the beginning of each of your turns, you can choose to maintain any Sustained Concentrations that you have active. Doing so immediately consumes one Sustained Concentration Rounds.

You can choose to drop a Sustained Concentration at any time, the same as normal concentration.

You must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability. 

## Artificer 
You can use an a Action or Bonus Action to complete a Greater Infusion, allowing you to share the benefits of one of your active infusions (an effect or item) with any creatures you can see or hear, to a maximum of 8. Multiple Greater Infusions can be used concurrently. 

Each usage lasts for 10 minutes, but the shared effects of any active Greater Infusions end at the conclusion of combat as a result of the strain of maintaining the effect.

You can do this a number of times equal to your Stronghold level, after which you must take an Extended Rest to refresh this ability.
