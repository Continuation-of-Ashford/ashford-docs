# Downtime Actions
Below you will find the various options you have when using your downtime.

All downtime projects (such as crafting a magic item, taming a creature, etc.) can only be performed by a single creature. Constructing settlement buildings is an exception and may be done communally. 

Some downtimes are always available, while many other downtimes need the use of a constructed building. Some downtimes can be done without a building but are made better by a building. 

Choose which settlement you are spending your downtime in and check the settlements thread to see what buildings are available.

#### Travel Costs
###### Made cheaper by the Caravanserai or Ferry buildings
At the start of each session, characters partaking in that session automatically arrive at the settlement the session starts at. (The DM might decide that settlements built very close to each other allow you to choose which one are at when starting the session, without cost)

If you want to do something at a settlement that isn't near the settlement where the session starts, you will need to pay a cost to travel in addition to the cost of your downtime.

Traveling works by going **from** the settlement where you spent your downtime, **to** the settlement where the session is taking place at.

The cost of traveling is 1gp per mile, calculated as the shortest available path, going around mountains and other impassible terrain. You can travel by land or by water, based on whatever is cheaper. This cost represents bribing random encounters to leave you alone, and renting a boat or horse. 

When you write down what downtime you are taking, also note how much gold you spent on traveling.

If a settlement is currently besieged, or if certain roads or waterways are blockaded, the DM will inform you that a Settlement is currently not available to Travel to/from/through.
*Such events can happen as a result of another session failing a quest, or the current session might revolve around dealing with a blockade or siege.*

#### Self Buffing
Some downtimes require Ability Checks. These Ability Checks take place gradually over multiple days of work. Short term buffs such as Guidance (1 minute duration) will run out before they can assist you with such checks. Only permanent (such as Halfling Luck) and 8 hour or longer duration improvements to Ability Checks (such as Foresight) can be used to improve downtime rolls.
*Note the Help downtime as the easiest way for players to buff each other's downtime rolls.*

## Downtimes that don't need buildings

### (De)Construct a Building
You can either begin constructing a new building, continue building one of your own buildings, or work on someone else's building in progress (with their character's permission).  You can either build [settlement buildings](settlement_buildings.md) or [strongholds](strongholds.md) if the settlement is of an appropriate level.

Players can pool their money and downtimes together to obtain particular benefits or purely to complete construction faster.

When multiple players contribute to the construction of a settlement or building, someone must be elected as the owner. Keep track of who contributed what to buildings in the thread for your settlement!

A settlement can construct any building of it's own tier or lower.
The first time any building has downtime spent building it, that character must pay the full listed cost of its construction.  No further payment is required to continue construction.

Settlement buildings can also be destroyed. Doing so incurs a cost in gold and downtimes equal to 1/4th the building's original cost (minimum 1 downtime and 125 gp).

The cost of destruction is paid by the settlement owner and distributed equally to any players other than the settlement owner who contributed to the building's original construction costs.

If the building is not yet complete, there is no gold cost associated with the destruction.

### Work
###### Can be improved by Hunting Post, Mine/Quarry or Smith buildings
###### Can be improved by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a downtime using your skills amongst the working class. 

Roll an Ability Check using a skill or tool proficiency you have and multiply the result by your level to find how much gold you earn.

||
|:---|
|For example, rolling a `16` Charisma (Persuasion) at level `12` gives you `16 Ã— 12` = `192` gold.|

### Help
You spend a downtime aiding an ally in their endeavors by forfeiting your time. You give one ally advantage on all checks they make in their downtime activity, excluding the Pit Fighting or Gambling downtime.    
When helping you can splitting any gold costs for the downtime, you don't split the rewards. 

###### Usually the best use for the Help downtime is when you ask another player to use their skills to craft an item for you, giving them advantage and paying part of the cost makes it more likely they can finish the item quickly.

### Scribing a spell scroll
###### Can be improved by the Arcane Scribe building
You spend a downtime(s) scribing a scroll, or contributing a spell scroll. Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell you want to scribe, as shown below. In addition you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or Calligraphy tools, provide any material components needed for the casting of the spell, and have the spell prepared - if possible - or among your known spells. If these numbers can be halved in any way such as a class feature, the result is rounded up.


| Spell Level | Time Cost  | Gold Cost |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Cantrip     | 3 per downtime | 25gp      |
| 1st         | 2 per downtime | 50gp      |
| 2nd         | 2 per downtime | 250gp     |
| 3rd         | 1 downtimes    | 500gp     |
| 4th         | 1 downtimes    | 1,000gp   |
| 5th         | 2 downtimes    | 2,500gp   |
| 6th         | 2 downtimes    | 5,000gp   |
| 7th         | 3 downtimes    | 15,000gp  |
| 8th         | 4 downtimes    | 25,000gp  |
| 9th         | 5 downtimes    | 100,000gp |

### Copying a Spell

When you find a wizard spell scroll or spell book (or a ritual spell for the ritual caster feat) of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

You may spend up to `2` hours per day copying spells into your spellbook *without consuming a downtime*, up to a `maximum of 14 hours per downtime`. If you choose to spend your downtime copying spells, you may spend up to `10` hours a day to a maximum of `70 hours per downtime`.

If your character needs less than 8 hours of sleep, such as a character with Sentry's Rest, Trance or Undying Nature, you may add those extra hours you can spend awake to the number of hours per day you may spend copying spells. 

If you wish to spend your downtime on copying spells, your base time increases to 56 hours, which can be further increased by not needing to sleep as above.

You must still find these spells, such as through a session, PC, or spell scroll. Spells copied in this way should have written at the bottom of their own descriptions who they were copied by.

### Crafting a Mundane Item 
###### Might require a Smith building of the relevant type.
###### Might be improved by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a downtime crafting items of the common populace. An item needs raw materials to be crafted, equal in gold (or a lower denomination if applicable) to half its listed price. 

To craft the item, take its price in gp and divide it by 50; that number is the total check result your character must accumulate by making relevant tool checks, to finish crafting the item. 
You can spend multiple downtimes crafting and add those rolls together to reach the required total if you cannot get it in a single roll. 

A character can sell an item crafted in this way to NPCs for its original listed price.

In addition, you may silver a non-magical weapon or ten pieces of non-magical ammunition for an additional 150 gp spent on raw materials.

## Downtimes that require buildings

### Education
###### Requires a University building in settlement
You receive education at a university for a language or tool to gain proficiency. This takes a number of downtimes equal to `10 minus your intelligence modifier` (minimum 1 downtime). Education in these classes requires a fee of 25gp per downtime.

### Gambling
###### Optionally enabled by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a downtime mingling with those who find thrill or opportunity in games of chance, reading your opponents in tests of luck and skill. 

* A character gambling in their downtime puts forward a wager of their desired gold amount and makes three checks: 
  * `Wisdom (Insight)`, 
  * `Charisma (Deception)`, 
  * and `Charisma (Intimidation)` or `Charisma (Persuasion)`. 
* If the character has proficiency with a gaming set, one of the checks can be replaced with one using that tool. 
* You can roll an additional check using `Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)` first. If you choose to do so, the DC for all the checks increases by +5, or by +10 if you are 11th level or higher.

#### Skill Checks 
The DCs are as follows per level bracket, rolled for each check independently by the DM:

| Levels    | DC Formula  |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 3 - 7     | `2d10+5`    |
| 8 - 16    | `2d10+10`   |
| 17 - 20   | `2d10+15`   |

#### Gambling Results 
If you fail your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) all successive rolls are automatic fails. It is up to the casino to allow you entry again should you get caught.

| Successes | Result      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0         | Not only do you lose your wager, but you also gain an equal amount of debt to the casino (or other establishment). |
| 1         | You lose your wager.      |
| 2         | You win gold equal to your wager. |
| 3         | You win 1.5x your wager.      |

The amount of gold you can wager is limited by your character bracket as follows.

| Bracket | Gold limit |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 3 - 7   | 350        |
| 8 - 12  | 550        |
| 13 - 16 | 750        |
| 17 - 20 | 1500       |

### Pit Fighting
###### Optionally enabled by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a downtime brawling in a showroom.

* You make a series of three checks, with the option to substitute one with an attack roll using a weapon: 
  * Strength (Athletics), 
  * Dexterity (Acrobatics),
  * and a Constitution saving throw. 
* The DC is determined by the quality of your opposition: easy, challenging, or deadly. 
* You earn gold depending on the number of successes achieved.

| Difficulty  | DC Formula | 1 success | 2 successes | 3 successes |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Amateur     | DC `2d10+1`   | `5d10`gp  | `15d10`gp   | `30d10`gp   |
| Professional| DC `2d10+15`  | `15d10`gp | `30d10`gp   | `60d10`gp   |
| Deadly      | DC `2d10+10`  | `30d10`gp | `60d10`gp   | `120d10`gp  |
| Legendary   | DC `2d10+15`  | `60d10`gp | `120d10`gp  | `250d10`gp  |


### Training
###### Requires Training Hall Building
If you are within 600 xp of the next level, you can spend the downtime training to reach the next level at minimum experience.

**At 20th level:**
If you have abilities that can be swapped upon leveling up or gaining an ASI (i.e. fighting styles, eldritch invocations, sorcerer spells) you can change them using this downtime.

### Taming
###### Requires the Stables, War Stables, or Wondrous Stables building or a Temple/Grove/Arena Stronghold
Players can spend downtime capturing and taming creatures to be their mount. For normal mounts they can be bought as shown in the item table.
Creatures you tame must live in the environment of the settlement you take the downtime in. For example, red dragons and wyverns can be found in mountainous settlements, blue dragons can be found in desert settlements, and bullettes can be found in forests.

* Creatures of 8 intelligence or higher cannot be tamed and named/titled/homebrew creatures are disallowed.
* Taming takes 1 downtime per CR of the creature being tamed, each downtime requires an animal handling check of 10 + CR + Creature INT mod.
* Only certain types of creatures can be tamed.  The list is as follows: **Beasts, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Monstrosities, and Plants**
* The DM rules which creatures can be trained. Both with regards to having the appropriate anatomy to be comfortably mounted, and with regards whether this creature has instincts that cannot be suppressed. (Things that consume souls for example, like the Hellfire Engine, things that cannot feasibly be ridden, like Fire Elementals, or immobile creatures.)

### Crafting a Magic Item
###### Requires the Enchanter or Arcane building relevant to item type
You spend a downtime investing funds and attention into enchanting a magical item.

* Using the table below, buying materials for the item will cost the rolled price for the rarity of the item. This price must be paid before any downtimes can be spent to craft the item. Also note the Special Costs section.
  * After rolling a price you have the option to not pay it and not proceed with the crafting, but your downtime is spent.
* If the item is an enchanted version of a non-magical item, that mundane item must also be provided as a component of the enchanting process. 
* Common items can be completed in one downtime without a skill check.

#### Gold Cost

| Rarity    | Price Formula     |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Common    | `(1d8+2) * 5`    |
| Uncommon  | `(1d10+2) * 25`   |
| Rare      | `(2d10+2) * 125`  |
| Very Rare | `(2d10+2) * 1250` |

#### Special Costs
* In addition to gold, Rare and Very Rare items require you to pay a component of equal rarity. These components may be recycled from other weapons (See Below) or received as loot for completing sessions.
* Wondrous items cost an additional 1.5 * rolled price.
* Ammunition items and weapons with the thrown property that lack a melee attack (Arrows, Bolts, Darts, Blowgun Darts, Sling Bullets, Renaissance Bullets) are crafted in batches of up to 20, at the cost of crafting a consumable item of that rarity.

> * When you provide the non-magical item to enchant, in the form of a weapon or pieces of ammunition you can pay an additional `1000`gp to make it an Adamantine weapon or ammunition in addition to enchanting it.

#### Downtime Cost
Taking the original price, divide it by 12.5 for uncommon, 25 for rare, or 100 for very rare. Keep track of this "Total Crafting DC." Each downtime used, you make a skill check using Arcana or a relevant tool and add it to the total progress you have made for crafting this item. When the total progress equals the Total Crafting DC, the item is complete.

The appropriate tools are (generally) as follows. If you are not sure, ask the DM or a Big Mans for a ruling.
* (Intelligence) Alchemist's Supplies: Poisons, Potions
* (Constitution) Brewer's Supplies: Potions
* (Dexterity) Cobbler's Tools: Footwear (i.e. Boots of Speed)
* (Dexterity) Jeweler's Tools: Jewelry (i.e. rings of protection)
* (Strength or Dexterity) Leatherworker's Tools: Saddles, Light Armor
* (Strength) Smith's Tools: Heavy Armor, Medium Armor, Weapons, Shields, other metallic items (i.e. guantlets of ogre strength)
* (Dexterity) Weaver's Tools: Items made predominantly from cloth (i.e. Robe of Eyes, Cloak of Protection)
* (Strength or Dexterity) Woodcarver's Tools: Items made predominantly from wood (i.e., a broom of flying)

### Scrapping a Magic Item
###### Requires the Enchanter or Arcane building relevant to item type
Occasionally, the party may find a magic item they can find no use or buyers for. In this case, it is prudent to extract its core components to recycle them into a more useful items.

 "Grinding up" an item into Residuum in such a way requires 3 downtimes for a Rare item or 6 downtimes for a Very Rare item. You also must pay `(2d10+2) * 62.5` gold for a Rare item or `(2d10+2) * 625` for a Very Rare item.

The resulting Residuum is a magical crafting component of an equal rarity to the item that was destroyed.

### Hiring an NPC Crafter
###### Requires the smith building relevant to the mundane item type
###### Requires the Enchanter or Arcane building relevant to the magic item type
###### Requires a guild feat or establishment in the settlement to provide artisans
Sometimes a character lacks the talent (or the patience) to craft an item by themselves. In these cases, they may use their downtime to contract others to construct the item for them. This downtime can be used to hire crafters for mundane or magical items on your behalf.
Hiring artisans incurs additional fees on top of the normal crafting costs. 
This functions the same as the [Crafting a Magic Item](#crafting-a-magic-item) and [Crafting a Mundane Item](crafting-a-mundane-item) downtimes, except you substitute the artisan's roll for your own when making progress towards the required total check result.

The quality of artisans willing to work for you depends on your level bracket.


| Level Bracket | Artisan     | Check      | Additional Cost |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 3 - 7         | Novice      | `1d20+1`   | `+25%` of crafting price |
| 8 - 12        | Apprentice  | `1d20+5`   | `+40%` of crafting price |
| 13 - 16       | Journeyman  | `1d20+10`  | `+60%` of crafting price |
| 17 - 20       | Master      | `1d20+20`  | `+80%` of crafting price |

### Buying a Magical Potion
###### Requires the Alchemist's Shack, House, Manor, or Mansion
During your downtime, you can buy up to four potions. The cost per potion is shown below.

| Rarity    | Price Formula     |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Common    | `(1d8+2) * 5`    |
| Uncommon  | `(1d10+2) * 25`   |
| Rare      | `(2d10+2) * 125`  |
| Very Rare | `(2d10+2) * 1250` |

### Legendary Search
#### When a character reaches level 17, they can begin a search for a legendary magical item.
To begin a legendary search, write a request in the [#Legendary Search Request Channel](https://discord.com/channels/638910062244528158/772629967087075338).  The request can be for any item of Legendary rarity.  Alternatively, with Big Mans approval, you can work with a DM to search for an upgraded version of an item of lesser rarity that would make it qualify as Legendary, an entirely homebrewed item, or something else of equal value.  
Finding your legendary item will take 1d6+6 Legendary Search downtimes.  The DM that accepts your request will roll this number in secret.  Every 2-3 downtimes, the sponsoring DM will run a session for your character in their quest to find their item.  You cannot take any Legendary Search downtimes while until this session is completed.
As an example, Joe Blow wants the CLoak of Invisibility.  He writes a request that is accepted by a DM, who then rolls that it will take 8 downtimes to find the item.  Joe completes 2 Legendary Search downtimes.  His DM tells him that he will have to complete a session to find a source of information for the location of the item.  He cannot complete his 3rd Legendary Search downtime until that session is completed.  When Joe completes 5 downtimes, his DM tells him he needs to complete a session to find the temple where the cloak is hidden, and cannot complete any more downtimes until that session is completed.  When Joe completes his 8th Legendary Search downtime, his DM runs the final session where Joe goes into the temple and receives his prize.
