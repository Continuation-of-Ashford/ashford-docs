# Downtime Actions
Below you will find the various options you have when using your downtime.

Some downtimes are always available, while many other downtimes need the use of a constructed building. Others can be done without but are made better by a building. 

Choose which settlement you are spending your downtime in and check the settlements thread to see what buildings are available. At the end of your downtime you need to be at the settlement the session is starting in, if you chose to spend your downtime in a different settlement, you will need to make your way there. Traveling before the start of a session costs `1`gp per mile traveled, along the most accessible route. (Settlement owners are encouraged to list the costs of frequently used routes in their settlement info) 

*Some downtimes require Ability Checks. These Ability Checks take place gradually over multiple days of work. Short term buffs such as Guidance (1 minute duration) will run out before they can assist you with such checks. Only 8 hour or longer duration improvements to Ability Checks (such as Foresight) can be used to improve downtime rolls.*

## Downtimes that don't need buildings

### (De)Construct a Building
You can either begin constructing a new building, continue building one of your own buildings, or work on someone else's building in progress (with their character's permission).  You can either build [settlement buildings](settlement_buildings.md) or [strongholds](strongholds.md) if the settlement is of an appropriate level.

Players can pool their money and downtimes together to obtain particular benefits or purely to complete construction faster.

When multiple players contribute to the construction of a settlement or building, someone must be elected as the owner. Keep track of who contributed what to buildings in the thread for your settlement!

A settlement can construct any building of it's own tier or lower.
The first time any building has downtime spent building it, that character must pay the full listed cost of its construction.  No further payment is required to continue construction.

Settlement buildings can also be destroyed. Doing so incurs a cost in gold and downtimes equal to 1/4th the building's original cost (minimum 1 downtime rounded up, minimum 125gp rounded up to nearest 5gp increment).

The cost of destruction is paid by the settlement owner and distributed equally to any players other than the settlement owner who contributed to the building's original construction costs.

If the building is not yet complete, there is no gold cost associated with the destruction.

### Work
###### Can be improved by Hunting Post, Mine/Quarry or Smith buildings
###### Can be improved by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a week using your skills amongst the working class. 

Roll an Ability Check using a skill or tool proficiency you have and multiply the result by your level to find how much gold you earn.

||
|:---|
|For example, rolling a `16` Charisma (Persuasion) at level `12` gives you `16 Ã— 12` = `192` gold.|


### Help
You spend a week aiding an ally in their endeavors by forfeiting your time. You give one ally advantage on all checks they make in their downtime activity, excluding the Pit Fighting downtime.    
When helping you can splitting any gold costs for the downtime, you don't split the rewards. 

Usually the best use for the Help downtime is when you ask another player to use their skills to craft an item for you, giving them advantage and paying part of the cost makes it more likely they can finish the item quickly.

### Scribing a spell scroll
###### Can be improved by the Arcane Scribe building
You spend a downtime(s) scribing a scroll, or contributing a spell scroll. Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell you want to scribe, as shown below. In addition you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or Calligraphy tools, provide any material components needed for the casting of the spell, and have the spell prepared - if possible - or among your known spells. If these numbers can be halved in any way such as a class feature, the result is rounded up.


| Spell Level | Time Cost  | Gold Cost |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Cantrip     | 3 per downtime | 25gp      |
| 1st         | 2 per downtime | 50gp      |
| 2nd         | 2 per downtime | 250gp     |
| 3rd         | 1 downtimes    | 500gp     |
| 4th         | 1 downtimes    | 1,000gp   |
| 5th         | 2 downtimes    | 2,500gp   |
| 6th         | 2 downtimes    | 5,000gp   |
| 7th         | 3 downtimes    | 15,000gp  |
| 8th         | 4 downtimes    | 25,000gp  |
| 9th         | 5 downtimes    | 100,000gp |

### Copying a Spell

When you find a wizard (or ritual spell for ritual caster) of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

You may spend up to `two (2)` hours per day copying spells into your spellbook *without consuming a downtime*, up to a `maximum of 14 hours per downtime`. 

If your character needs less than 8 hours of sleep, such as a character with Sentry's Rest, Trance or Undying Nature, you may add those hours to copying spells for 4 hours and 6 hours respectively, up to 32 hours or 42 hours. 

If you wish to spend your downtime on copying spells, your base time increases to 56 hours, which can be increased by not needing to sleep as above.

You must still find these spells, such as through a session, PC, or spell scroll. Spells copied in this way should have written at the bottom of their own descriptions who they were copied by.

### Crafting a Mundane Item 
###### Might require a Smith building of the relevant type.
###### Might be improved by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a week crafting items of the common populace. An item needs raw materials to be crafted, equal in gold or a lower denomination if applicable, to half its listed price. To craft the item, take its price and divide it by 50. This is the total amount your character must meet per relevant tool check, per downtime. A character can sell an item crafted in this way to NPCs for its original listed price.

In addition, you may silver a non-magical weapon or ten pieces of non-magical ammunition for an additional 150 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

## Downtimes that require buildings

### Education
###### Requires a University building in settlement
You receive education at a university for a language or tool to gain proficiency. This typically takes 10 weeks, but this time is reduced by a number of weeks equal to your character's Intelligence modifier if positive at a minimum of 1 week. Education in these classes requires a fee of 25gp per week.

### Gambling
###### Optionally enabled by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a week mingling with those who find thrill or opportunity in games of chance, reading your opponents in tests of luck and skill. 

* A character gambling in their downtime puts forward a wager of their desired gold amount and makes three checks: 
  * `Wisdom (Insight)`, 
  * `Charisma (Deception)`, 
  * and `Charisma (Intimidation)` or `Charisma (Persuasion)`. 
* If the character has proficiency with a gaming set, one of the checks can be replaced with one using that tool. 
* You can additionally roll a `Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)` which adds a +5 to the DC at levels 3 to 10 and a +10 at levels 11 to 20.

#### Skill Checks 
The DCs are as follows per level bracket, rolled for each check independently by the DM:

| Levels    | DC Formula  |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 3 - 7     | `2d10+5`    |
| 8 - 16    | `2d10+10`   |
| 17 - 20   | `2d10+15`   |

#### Gambling Results 
If you fail your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) all successive rolls are automatic fails. It is up to the casino to allow you entry again should you get caught.

| Successes | Result      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0         | Not only do you lose your wager, but you also gain an equal amount of debt to the casino (or other establishment). |
| 1         | You lose half your wager.      |
| 2         | You win 1.5x times your wager. |
| 3         | You win twice your wager.      |

### Pit Fighting
###### Optionally enabled by an Establishment's Demesne Effect
You spend a week brawling in a showroom.

* You make a series of three checks, with the option to substitute one with an attack roll using a weapon: 
  * Strength (Athletics), 
  * Dexterity (Acrobatics),
  * and a Constitution saving throw. 
* The DC is determined by the quality of your opposition: easy, challenging, or deadly. 
* You earn gold depending on the number of successes achieved.

| Difficulty  | DC Formula | 1 success | 2 successes | 3 successes |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Easy        | `2d10+5`   | `3d10`gp  | `6d10`gp    | `10d10`gp   |
| Challenging | `2d10+10`  | `15d10`gp | `30d10`gp   | `50d10`gp   |
| Deadly      | `2d10+15`  | `30d10`gp | `60d10`gp   | `100d10`gp  |


### Training Hall
###### Requires Training Hall Building
If you are within 600 xp of the next level, you can spend the downtime training to reach the next level at minimum experience.

**At 20th level:**
If you have abilities that can be swapped upon leveling up or gaining an ASI (i.e. fighting styles, eldritch invocations, sorcerer spells) you can swap them using this downtime. For each use of this downtime, you can only swap as many as leveling up once, would allow you to swap.

### Taming
###### Requires the Stables, War Stables, or Wondrous Stables building or a Temple/Grove/Arena Stronghold
Players can spend downtime capturing and taming creatures to be their mount. For normal mounts they can be bought as shown in the item table.

* Creatures of 8 intelligence or higher cannot be tamed and named/titled/homebrew creatures are disallowed.
* Taming takes 1 downtime per CR of the creature being tamed, each downtime requires an animal handling check of 10 + CR + Creature INT mod.
* The DM rules which creatures can be trained. Both with regards to having the appropriate anatomy to be comfortably mounted, and with regards whether this creature has instincts that cannot be suppressed. (Things that consume souls for example, like the Hellfire Engine.)

### Crafting a Magic Item
###### Requires the Enchanter or Arcane building relevant to item type
You spend a week investing funds and attention into enchanting a magical item, doing so requires either proficiency in the Arcana skill or a relevant tool. 

* Using the table below, buying materials for the item will cost ***half of the rolled price*** and items rare or higher require specific relevant components as well. 
  * After rolling a price you have the option to not proceed with the crafting, but the downtime is spent.
* If the item is an enchanted version of a nonmagical item, that mundane item must also be provided as a component of the enchanting process. 
* Common items or 2 consumable common items can be completed in one week without a skill check.
* You cannot create Legendary items. 

#### Gold Cost

| Rarity    | Price Formula     |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Common    | `(1d8+2) * 10`    |
| Uncommon  | `(1d10+2) * 50`   |
| Rare      | `(2d10+2) * 250`  |
| Very Rare | `(2d10+2) * 2500` |

##### Special Costs
* Adamantine items such as armor, ammunition and weapons cost base price in addition to 1000 gp.
* Wondrous items cost an additional 1.5 * rolled price.
* Scrolls cost an additional 1d10 * 10% + rolled price.

#### Downtime Cost
Taking the original price, divide it by 25 for uncommon, 50 for rare or 200 for very rare. Keep track of this number. Each downtime used, you make a skill check using Arcana or a relevant tool and subtract it from the above, carrying this new number forward if it is not 0. When the number reaches 0 the item is complete.

### Scrapping a Magic Item
###### Requires the Enchanter or Arcane building relevant to item type
Occasionally, the party may find a magic item they can find no use or buyers for. In this case, it is prudent to extract its core components to recycle them into a more useful items.

 "Grinding up" an item into Residuum in such a way requires 3 downtimes for a rare item or 6 downtimes for a very rare item. 

The resulting Residuum is a magical crafting component of an equal rarity to the item that was destroyed.

### Hiring an NPC Crafter
###### Requires the Enchanter or Arcane building relevant to item type
Sometimes a character lacks the talent (or the patience) to craft an item by themselves. In these cases, they may use their downtime to contract others to construct the item for them. Hiring more competent crafters incurs additional fees over normal magic crafting. This functions the same as the [Crafting a Magic](#crafting-a-magic-item) Item downtime, except you substitute the artisan's roll for your own. The quality of artisans available depends on your level bracket.


| Level Bracket | Artisan     | Check      | Additional Cost |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 3 - 7         | Novice      | `1d20+1`   | `+25%` of rolled crafting price |
| 8 - 12        | Apprentice  | `1d20+5`   | `+40%` of rolled crafting price |
| 13 - 16       | Journeyman  | `1d20+10`  | `+60%` of rolled crafting price |
| 17 - 20       | Master      | `1d20+20`  | `+80%` of rolled crafting price |
