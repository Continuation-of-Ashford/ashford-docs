# Foundry VTT
We use [Foundry virtual tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com)! Please ping the `@Big Mans` or `@Dungeon Masters` roles on Discord to be given a login. 

The Foundry server will automatically shut down after a period of inactivity. If you need it to be turned back on, please ping `@Big Mans` or `@Dungeon Masters` on Discord.

(TBD: Add link publicly here?)

# Sheets
When it comes to character sheets, you have two options:

1. [5etools](https://5e.tools)
2. D&D Beyond

This guide generally assumes that you will be using option #1 as it's what most of the server uses and doesn't require buying all of the content digitally. ~~Digital access codes with book purchases when, WOTC!?~~

## 5etools Charactermancer 
If you choose to create your sheet through 5etools, then you get to use the wonderful Charactermancer plugin! 

Learn how to populate your sheet in the [Charactermancer Guide](charactermancer.md)

## D&D Beyond Importer
If you choose to create your sheet through D&D Beyond, you'll need to import that sheet onto Foundry via a plugin.

Learn how to populate your sheet in the [D&D Beyond Setup Guide](dndbeyond.md)
