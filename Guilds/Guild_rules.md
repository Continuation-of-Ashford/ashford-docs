# Birth of the Guild

A guild is born from the desire of the players to impose themselves on the territory of their surrounding. Everything starts from a the foundations of: a building where
the guild can establish a seat, a common ideology that new members can identify with, and finally the rules and principles that guide it in its actions in the territory; then, over time, you can expand the ranks of the members and expand further.

The minimum foundations for creating a guild are: 
~ Name
~ Role. (Assassin's guild, Mages Guild, Mercenary Guild, Ect)
~ Goals. (Profit, ideological movement, changes to the norm, ect)
~ Founder.
~ Members. (Minimum three to start a guild)
~ Desired Demographics. (Magic users, Rogues, ect)
~ Symbol. 
~ Motto. (optional)
~ First Contact and Guild Establishment Mission. (Westmarch specific rule)

# Guild Regulations

It is essential that the guild writes an internal regulation to be respected, which sets out the reasons and objectives that each member must pursue, as well as the rules that each member must follow. It would also be good to define the order of the chain of command so that we know which orders to respect and by whom. All this must, of course, be decided by the founders of the guild. When chartering a new guild- these regulations and above described foundations are to be submitted to the Big Mans IOT regulate the creation of new guilds.

# Guild Leveling and Ranks

The system is based on 5 Levels, in order to level up it is necessary to successfully complete a number of missions as shown in the GUILD EXP table. Obviously
the more the guild rises the greater the number of successes necessary to increase its influence on Ashford and grow. The table also shows the maximum number of members that the guild can support and the minimum number of members needed to not drop in level. There are 5 different stages for a guild: the ranks, which give access to some benefits once reached. However, to move from one rank to the next you must have a minimum guild exp and a minimum number of members.

➢ Popular (P): The organization is known to few common folk and carries out missions on commission requested by the people themselves who need help. At this stage there is a max of four characters that can be supported on a mission at a time from that guild.

➢ Official (O): The organization is known within the local community it is established and carries out missions on commission requested by the people themselves who need help and further begins to receive official contracts from local authority. At this stage there is a max of six characters that can be supported on a mission at a time from that guild.

➢ Heroic (H): The guild is now renowned throughout the region of Ashford, and calls for help are coming from every corner. The fame spreads and reaches the ears of the rulers. At this stage there is no longer a member cap on how many can attend a mission.

➢ Legendary (L): The guild's exploits are now renowned or infamous. More and more daring missions are coming to your boards and everyone on Ashford recognizes your coat of arms!

➢ Worldwide (W): Your guild is renowned to the ends of the world, you are an example and they come from every land to admire/combat you, ask for help/threaten you.

# Leveling Up

In order for the guild to rise to a higher level, certain conditions must be met: 

➢ Having successfully passed the minimum number of missions necessary to accumulate experience among members and increase the reputation of the guild.

➢ To have the minimum number of locations indicated in the table, so as to better manage the expanding operations.

➢ Have the minimum number of members.

**Rank**|**Level**|**Missions to Grow**|**Max Mission Members**|**Min Guild members**|**Minimum Strongholds**

## Guild Downtimes

During guild specific mission downtime's you can achieve extraordinary successes or terrible failures, the tables below help to establish exceptional rewards in case there is a critical Success or the consequences of the Failure of the mission.

# Guild Economy and Maintenance

A Guild is a complex organization that requires funds to be able to sustain itself and act on the territory, these funds come mainly from minor missions and tasks that the guild performs daily, small jobs that are not dealt with directly in the game. These monetary revenues are counted as the guild members' lifestyle and are not directly usable in any other way. However, the treasures and coins with which the guild is remunerated during periodic missions and any income that the characters decide to allocate directly from their adventures are extraordinary funds that must be taken into account, they can be used on the basis of needs, to buy equipment, expand a specific location, start a business with which to increase revenue, etc. Upon chartering a new guild, or after the guild levels up, Big Mans will evaluate that guild and determine the Downtime to Downtime upkeep of the guild

Before conducting a guild downtime, the guild will have to carry out some operations to check the economic situation of the guild. This is used to calculate the gains or losses resulting from commercial activities, allocate special funds or put some nest egg in the coffers for the days of crisis:
**Downtime** | **Upkeep Activity Results**
:-----:|:-----:
1-20	| You must pay double guild tithes.
21-35	| You must pay normal guild tithes.
36-50	| You must pay half guild tithes.
51-60	| Downtime activities cover your tithes and the guild is maintained at no cost.
61-98	| The activity covers its own costs.  In addition to characters not paying tithes, the mission generates an additional 1d4+1 * 10 gold.
99-100	| Magic item: activites yield a magic item from table H.

# Guild Inventory

Monetary value that is earned for completing actions are deposited into the guild inventory. This is money that is not accessible for individuals members but is to be used only for the guild improvement and activities only. Random events (some specified above) will cause the guild to gain money or items unforeseen and can then be divided among members at that time. (I.E. guild airship- guild coffers or accumulated wealth, guild NPCs, ect)
# Guild Property

Guilds are comparable to a player on Ashford when calculating and utilizing property. I.E.: If a player joins a guild and offers to give up one of their three establishments, that establishment is now property of the guild and no longer the player. If that property offered income during downtime and 1 action surge that can be used during a mission, the player that offered up that property can no longer gain that bonus as an individual but is to be used as a collective by the guild for a mission. Example- a guild has three establishments- for that mission the party as a whole has three action surges to use, and gain the whole of the downtime outcome from those establishments divided up between that party for that mission. All guild members gain the first level benefits of the stronghold given up to the guild- but the stronghold remains level 1 indefinitely. (‘Can’ benefit, but must utilize the stronghold’s town location as your downtime, per usual)
# Additional rules:
•	An actual player can only have one guild master character at a time
•	Individual player characters can not be in multiple guilds at once- but players can have multiple characters in different guilds
•	Guild benefits: 1 benefit will be downtime or skill related and 1 benefit will be utility and RP related
•	Players that are in a guild must pay 5% of their mission gold reward every mission as a tithe to the guild- this is deposited into guild funds.
